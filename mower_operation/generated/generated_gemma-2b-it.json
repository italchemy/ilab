            "### DANGER\n\nThis machine was built to be operated according to the safe operation practices in this manual. As with any type of power equipment, carelessness or error on the part of the operator can result in serious injury. This machine is capable of amputating fingers, hands, toes and feet and throwing objects. Failure to observe the following safety instructions could result in serious injury or death.\n\n### General Operation",
            "1. Read this operator's manual carefully in its entirety before attempting to assemble this machine. Read, understand, and follow all instructions on the machine and in the manual(s) before operation. Keep this manual in a safe place for future and regular reference and for ordering replacement parts.\n2. Be completely familiar with the controls and the proper use of this machine before operating it.\n3. This machine is a precision piece of power equipment, not a plaything. Therefore, exercise extreme caution at all times. This machine has been designed to perform one job: to mow grass. Do not use it for any other purpose.\n4. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and should be trained and supervised by an adult.\n5. Only responsible individuals who are familiar with these rules of safe operation should be allowed to use this machine.\n6. Thoroughly inspect the area where the equipment is to be used. Remove all stones, sticks, wire, bones, toys and other foreign objects, which could be tripped over or picked up and thrown by the blade. Thrown objects can cause serious personal injury.\n7. Plan your mowing pattern to avoid discharge of material toward roads, sidewalks, bystanders and the like. Also, avoid discharging material against a wall or obstruction, which may cause discharged material to ricochet back toward the operator.\n8. To help avoid blade contact or a thrown object injury, stay in operator zone behind handles and keep children, bystanders, helpers and pets at least 75 feet from mower while it is in operation. Stop machine if anyone enters area.\n9. Always wear safety glasses or safety goggles during operation and while performing an adjustment or repair to protect your eyes. Thrown objects which ricochet can cause serious injury to the eyes.\n10. Wear sturdy, rough-soled work shoes and close-fitting slacks and shirts. Shirts and pants that cover the arms and legs and steel-toed shoes are recommended. Never operate this machine in bare feet, sandals, slippery or lightweight (e.g., canvas) shoes.\n11. Do not put hands or feet near rotating parts or under the cutting deck. Contact with blade can amputate fingers, hands, toes and feet.\n12. A missing or damaged discharge cover can cause blade contact or thrown object injuries.\n13. Many injuries occur as a result of the mower being pulled over the foot during a fall caused by slipping or tripping. Do not hold onto the mower if you are falling; release the handle immediately.\n14. Never pull the mower back toward you while you are walking. If you must back the mower away from a wall or obstruction first look down and behind to avoid tripping and then follow these steps:\n    - Step back from mower to fully extend your arms.\n    - Be sure you are well balanced with sure footing.\n    - Pull the mower back slowly, no more than halfway toward you.\n    - Repeat these steps as needed.\n15. Do not operate the mower while under the influence of alcohol or drugs.\n16. Do not engage the self-propelled mechanism on machines so equipped while starting engine.\n17. The blade control is a safety device. Never attempt to bypass its operation. Doing so makes the safety device inoperative and may result in personal injury through contact with the rotating blade. The blade control must operate easily in both directions and automatically return to the disengaged position when released.\n18. Never operate the mower in wet grass. Always be sure of your footing. A slip and fall can cause serious personal injury. If you feel you are losing your footing, release the blade control handle immediately and the blade will stop rotating within three seconds.\n19. Mow only in daylight or good artificial light. Walk, never run.\n20. Stop the blade when crossing gravel drives, walks or roads.\n21. If the equipment should start to vibrate abnormally, stop the engine and check immediately for the cause. Vibration is generally a warning of trouble.\n22. Shut the engine off and wait until the blade comes to a complete stop before removing the grass catcher or unclogging the chute. The cutting blade continues to rotate for a few seconds after the blade control is released. Never place any part of the body in the blade area until you are sure the blade has stopped rotating.\n23. Never operate mower without proper trail shield, discharge cover, grass catcher, blade control or other safety protective devices in place and working. Never operate mower with damaged safety devices. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.\n24. Muffler and engine become hot and can cause a burn. Do not touch.\n25. Never attempt to make a wheel or cutting height adjustment while the engine is running.\n26. Only use parts and accessories made for this machine by the manufacturer. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.",
            "27. When starting engine, pull cord slowly until resistance is felt, then pull rapidly. Rapid retraction of starter cord (kickback) will pull hand and arm toward engine faster than you can let go. Broken bones, fractures, bruises or sprains could result.\n28. If situations occur which are not covered in this manual, use care and good judgment. Contact Customer Support for assistance and the name of your nearest servicing dealer.",
            "### Children\n\nTragic accidents can occur if the operator is not alert to the presence of children. Children are often attracted to the mower and the mowing activity. They do not understand the dangers. Never assume that children will remain where you last saw them.\n\n1. Keep children out of the mowing area and under watchful care of a responsible adult other than the operator.\n2. Be alert and turn mower off if a child enters the area.\n3. Before and while moving backwards, look behind and down for small children.\n4. Use extreme care when approaching blind corners, doorways, shrubs, trees, or other objects that may block your vision of a child who may run into the mower.\n5. Keep children away from hot or running engines. They can suffer burns from a hot muffler.\n6. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and be trained and supervised by an adult.\n\n### Service\n\nSafe Handling of Gasoline\n\nTo avoid personal injury or property damage, use extreme care in handling gasoline. Gasoline is extremely flammable and the vapors are explosive. Serious personal injury can occur when gasoline is spilled on yourself or your clothes, which can ignite. Wash your skin and change clothes immediately.\n\n1. Use only an approved gasoline container.\n2. Never fill containers inside a vehicle or on a truck or trailer bed with a plastic liner. Always place containers on the ground away from your vehicle before filling.\n3. Remove gas-powered equipment from the truck or trailer and refuel it on the ground. If this is not possible, then refuel such equipment on a trailer with a portable container, rather than from a gasoline dispenser nozzle.\n4. Keep the nozzle in contact with the rim of the fuel tank or container opening at all times until fueling is complete. Do not use a nozzle lock-open device.\n5. Extinguish all cigarettes, cigars, pipes and other sources of ignition.\n6. Never fuel machine indoors because flammable vapors will accumulate in the area.\n7. Never remove gas cap or add fuel while the engine is hot or running. Allow engine to cool at least two minutes before refueling.\n8. Never overfill fuel tank. Fill tank to no more than \u00bd inch below bottom of filler neck to provide space for fuel expansion.\n9. Replace gasoline cap and tighten securely.\n10. If gasoline is spilled, wipe it off the engine and equipment. Move machine to another area. Wait 5 minutes before starting engine.\n11. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light (e.g. furnace, water heater, space heater, clothes dryer, etc.).\n12. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n13. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light such as a water heater, furnace, clothes dryer etc.\n14. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n\n---\n\n## General Service\n\n1. Never run an engine indoors or in a poorly ventilated area. Engine exhaust contains carbon monoxide, an odorless and deadly gas.\n2. Before cleaning, repairing, or inspecting, make certain the blade and all moving parts have stopped. Disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine to prevent unintended starting.\n3. Check the blade and engine mounting bolts at frequent intervals for proper tightness. Also, visually inspect blade for damage (e.g., bent, cracked, worn). Replace blade with the original equipment manufacturer\u2019s (O.E.M.) blade only, listed in this manual. \u201cUse of parts which do not meet the original equipment specifications may lead to improper performance and compromise safety!\u201d\n4. Mower blades are sharp and can cut. Wrap the blade or wear gloves, and use extra caution when servicing them.\n5. Keep all nuts, bolts, and screws tight to be sure the equipment is in safe working condition.\n6. Never tamper with safety devices. Check their proper operation regularly.\n7. After striking a foreign object, stop the engine, disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine. Thoroughly inspect the mower for any damage. Repair the damage before starting and operating the mower.\n8. Never attempt to make adjustments or repairs to the mower while the engine is running.\n9. Grass catcher components are subject to wear, damage and deterioration, which could expose moving parts or allow objects to be thrown. Frequently check components and replace with the manufacturer\u2019s recommended parts when necessary.\n10. Mower blades are sharp and can cut. Wrap the blade or wear gloves, and use extra caution when servicing them.\n11. Do not change the engine governor setting or over-speed the engine.

            "### DANGER\n\nThis machine was built to be operated according to the safe operation practices in this manual. As with any type of power equipment, carelessness or error on the part of the operator can result in serious injury. This machine is capable of amputating fingers, hands, toes and feet and throwing objects. Failure to observe the following safety instructions could result in serious injury or death.\n\n### General Operation",
            "1. Read this operator's manual carefully in its entirety before attempting to assemble this machine. Read, understand, and follow all instructions on the machine and in the manual(s) before operation. Keep this manual in a safe place for future and regular reference and for ordering replacement parts.\n2. Be completely familiar with the controls and the proper use of this machine before operating it.\n3. This machine is a precision piece of power equipment, not a plaything. Therefore, exercise extreme caution at all times. This machine has been designed to perform one job: to mow grass. Do not use it for any other purpose.\n4. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and should be trained and supervised by an adult.\n5. Only responsible individuals who are familiar with these rules of safe operation should be allowed to use this machine.\n6. Thoroughly inspect the area where the equipment is to be used. Remove all stones, sticks, wire, bones, toys and other foreign objects, which could be tripped over or picked up and thrown by the blade. Thrown objects can cause serious personal injury.\n7. Plan your mowing pattern to avoid discharge of material toward roads, sidewalks, bystanders and the like. Also, avoid discharging material against a wall or obstruction, which may cause discharged material to ricochet back toward the operator.\n8. To help avoid blade contact or a thrown object injury, stay in operator zone behind handles and keep children, bystanders, helpers and pets at least 75 feet from mower while it is in operation. Stop machine if anyone enters area.\n9. Always wear safety glasses or safety goggles during operation and while performing an adjustment or repair to protect your eyes. Thrown objects which ricochet can cause serious injury to the eyes.\n10. Wear sturdy, rough-soled work shoes and close-fitting slacks and shirts. Shirts and pants that cover the arms and legs and steel-toed shoes are recommended. Never operate this machine in bare feet, sandals, slippery or lightweight (e.g., canvas) shoes.\n11. Do not put hands or feet near rotating parts or under the cutting deck. Contact with blade can amputate fingers, hands, toes and feet.\n12. A missing or damaged discharge cover can cause blade contact or thrown object injuries.\n13. Many injuries occur as a result of the mower being pulled over the foot during a fall caused by slipping or tripping. Do not hold onto the mower if you are falling; release the handle immediately.\n14. Never pull the mower back toward you while you are walking. If you must back the mower away from a wall or obstruction first look down and behind to avoid tripping and then follow these steps:\n    - Step back from mower to fully extend your arms.\n    - Be sure you are well balanced with sure footing.\n    - Pull the mower back slowly, no more than halfway toward you.\n    - Repeat these steps as needed.\n15. Do not operate the mower while under the influence of alcohol or drugs.\n16. Do not engage the self-propelled mechanism on machines so equipped while starting engine.\n17. The blade control is a safety device. Never attempt to bypass its operation. Doing so makes the safety device inoperative and may result in personal injury through contact with the rotating blade. The blade control must operate easily in both directions and automatically return to the disengaged position when released.\n18. Never operate the mower in wet grass. Always be sure of your footing. A slip and fall can cause serious personal injury. If you feel you are losing your footing, release the blade control handle immediately and the blade will stop rotating within three seconds.\n19. Mow only in daylight or good artificial light. Walk, never run.\n20. Stop the blade when crossing gravel drives, walks or roads.\n21. If the equipment should start to vibrate abnormally, stop the engine and check immediately for the cause. Vibration is generally a warning of trouble.\n22. Shut the engine off and wait until the blade comes to a complete stop before removing the grass catcher or unclogging the chute. The cutting blade continues to rotate for a few seconds after the blade control is released. Never place any part of the body in the blade area until you are sure the blade has stopped rotating.\n23. Never operate mower without proper trail shield, discharge cover, grass catcher, blade control or other safety protective devices in place and working. Never operate mower with damaged safety devices. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.\n24. Muffler and engine become hot and can cause a burn. Do not touch.\n25. Never attempt to make a wheel or cutting height adjustment while the engine is running.\n26. Only use parts and accessories made for this machine by the manufacturer. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.",
            "27. When starting engine, pull cord slowly until resistance is felt, then pull rapidly. Rapid retraction of starter cord (kickback) will pull hand and arm toward engine faster than you can let go. Broken bones, fractures, bruises or sprains could result.\n28. If situations occur which are not covered in this manual, use care and good judgment. Contact Customer Support for assistance and the name of your nearest servicing dealer.",
            "### Children\n\nTragic accidents can occur if the operator is not alert to the presence of children. Children are often attracted to the mower and the mowing activity. They do not understand the dangers. Never assume that children will remain where you last saw them.\n\n1. Keep children out of the mowing area and under watchful care of a responsible adult other than the operator.\n2. Be alert and turn mower off if a child enters the area.\n3. Before and while moving backwards, look behind and down for small children.\n4. Use extreme care when approaching blind corners, doorways, shrubs, trees, or other objects that may block your vision of a child who may run into the mower.\n5. Keep children away from hot or running engines. They can suffer burns from a hot muffler.\n6. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and be trained and supervised by an adult.\n\n### Service\n\nSafe Handling of Gasoline\n\nTo avoid personal injury or property damage, use extreme care in handling gasoline. Gasoline is extremely flammable and the vapors are explosive. Serious personal injury can occur when gasoline is spilled on yourself or your clothes, which can ignite. Wash your skin and change clothes immediately.\n\n1. Use only an approved gasoline container.\n2. Never fill containers inside a vehicle or on a truck or trailer bed with a plastic liner. Always place containers on the ground away from your vehicle before filling.\n3. Remove gas-powered equipment from the truck or trailer and refuel it on the ground. If this is not possible, then refuel such equipment on a trailer with a portable container, rather than from a gasoline dispenser nozzle.\n4. Keep the nozzle in contact with the rim of the fuel tank or container opening at all times until fueling is complete. Do not use a nozzle lock-open device.\n5. Extinguish all cigarettes, cigars, pipes and other sources of ignition.\n6. Never fuel machine indoors because flammable vapors will accumulate in the area.\n7. Never remove gas cap or add fuel while the engine is hot or running. Allow engine to cool at least two minutes before refueling.\n8. Never overfill fuel tank. Fill tank to no more than \u00bd inch below bottom of filler neck to provide space for fuel expansion.\n9. Replace gasoline cap and tighten securely.\n10. If gasoline is spilled, wipe it off the engine and equipment. Move machine to another area. Wait 5 minutes before starting engine.\n11. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light (e.g. furnace, water heater, space heater, clothes dryer, etc.).\n12. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n13. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light such as a water heater, furnace, clothes dryer etc.\n14. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n\n---\n\n## General Service\n\n1. Never run an engine indoors or in a poorly ventilated area. Engine exhaust contains carbon monoxide, an odorless and deadly gas.\n2. Before cleaning, repairing, or inspecting, make certain the blade and all moving parts have stopped. Disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine to prevent unintended starting.\n3. Check the blade and engine mounting bolts at frequent intervals for proper tightness. Also, visually inspect blade for damage (e.g., bent, cracked, worn). Replace blade with the original equipment manufacturer\u2019s (O.E.M.) blade only, listed in this manual. \u201cUse of parts which do not meet the original equipment specifications may lead to improper performance and compromise safety!\u201d\n4. Mower blades are sharp and can cut. Wrap the blade or wear gloves, and use extra caution when servicing them.\n5. Keep all nuts, bolts, and screws tight to be sure the equipment is in safe working condition.\n6. Never tamper with safety devices. Check their proper operation regularly.\n7. After striking a foreign object, stop the engine, disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine. Thoroughly inspect the mower for any damage. Repair the damage before starting and operating the mower.\n8. Never attempt to make adjustments or repairs to the mower while the engine is running.\n9. Grass catcher components are subject to wear, damage and deterioration, which could expose moving parts or allow objects to be thrown. Frequently check components and replace with the manufacturer\u2019s recommended parts when necessary.\n10. Mower blades are sharp and can cut. Wrap the blade or wear gloves, and use extra caution when servicing them.\n11. Do not change the engine governor setting or over-speed the engine.

            "### DANGER\n\nThis machine was built to be operated according to the safe operation practices in this manual. As with any type of power equipment, carelessness or error on the part of the operator can result in serious injury. This machine is capable of amputating fingers, hands, toes and feet and throwing objects. Failure to observe the following safety instructions could result in serious injury or death.\n\n### General Operation",
            "1. Read this operator's manual carefully in its entirety before attempting to assemble this machine. Read, understand, and follow all instructions on the machine and in the manual(s) before operation. Keep this manual in a safe place for future and regular reference and for ordering replacement parts.\n2. Be completely familiar with the controls and the proper use of this machine before operating it.\n3. This machine is a precision piece of power equipment, not a plaything. Therefore, exercise extreme caution at all times. This machine has been designed to perform one job: to mow grass. Do not use it for any other purpose.\n4. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and should be trained and supervised by an adult.\n5. Only responsible individuals who are familiar with these rules of safe operation should be allowed to use this machine.\n6. Thoroughly inspect the area where the equipment is to be used. Remove all stones, sticks, wire, bones, toys and other foreign objects, which could be tripped over or picked up and thrown by the blade. Thrown objects can cause serious personal injury.\n7. Plan your mowing pattern to avoid discharge of material toward roads, sidewalks, bystanders and the like. Also, avoid discharging material against a wall or obstruction, which may cause discharged material to ricochet back toward the operator.\n8. To help avoid blade contact or a thrown object injury, stay in operator zone behind handles and keep children, bystanders, helpers and pets at least 75 feet from mower while it is in operation. Stop machine if anyone enters area.\n9. Always wear safety glasses or safety goggles during operation and while performing an adjustment or repair to protect your eyes. Thrown objects which ricochet can cause serious injury to the eyes.\n10. Wear sturdy, rough-soled work shoes and close-fitting slacks and shirts. Shirts and pants that cover the arms and legs and steel-toed shoes are recommended. Never operate this machine in bare feet, sandals, slippery or lightweight (e.g., canvas) shoes.\n11. Do not put hands or feet near rotating parts or under the cutting deck. Contact with blade can amputate fingers, hands, toes and feet.\n12. A missing or damaged discharge cover can cause blade contact or thrown object injuries.\n13. Many injuries occur as a result of the mower being pulled over the foot during a fall caused by slipping or tripping. Do not hold onto the mower if you are falling; release the handle immediately.\n14. Never pull the mower back toward you while you are walking. If you must back the mower away from a wall or obstruction first look down and behind to avoid tripping and then follow these steps:\n    - Step back from mower to fully extend your arms.\n    - Be sure you are well balanced with sure footing.\n    - Pull the mower back slowly, no more than halfway toward you.\n    - Repeat these steps as needed.\n15. Do not operate the mower while under the influence of alcohol or drugs.\n16. Do not engage the self-propelled mechanism on machines so equipped while starting engine.\n17. The blade control is a safety device. Never attempt to bypass its operation. Doing so makes the safety device inoperative and may result in personal injury through contact with the rotating blade. The blade control must operate easily in both directions and automatically return to the disengaged position when released.\n18. Never operate the mower in wet grass. Always be sure of your footing. A slip and fall can cause serious personal injury. If you feel you are losing your footing, release the blade control handle immediately and the blade will stop rotating within three seconds.\n19. Mow only in daylight or good artificial light. Walk, never run.\n20. Stop the blade when crossing gravel drives, walks or roads.\n21. If the equipment should start to vibrate abnormally, stop the engine and check immediately for the cause. Vibration is generally a warning of trouble.\n22. Shut the engine off and wait until the blade comes to a complete stop before removing the grass catcher or unclogging the chute. The cutting blade continues to rotate for a few seconds after the blade control is released. Never place any part of the body in the blade area until you are sure the blade has stopped rotating.\n23. Never operate mower without proper trail shield, discharge cover, grass catcher, blade control or other safety protective devices in place and working. Never operate mower with damaged safety devices. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.\n24. Muffler and engine become hot and can cause a burn. Do not touch.\n25. Never attempt to make a wheel or cutting height adjustment while the engine is running.\n26. Only use parts and accessories made for this machine by the manufacturer. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.",
            "27. When starting engine, pull cord slowly until resistance is felt, then pull rapidly. Rapid retraction of starter cord (kickback) will pull hand and arm toward engine faster than you can let go. Broken bones, fractures, bruises or sprains could result.\n28. If situations occur which are not covered in this manual, use care and good judgment. Contact Customer Support for assistance and the name of your nearest servicing dealer.",
            "### Children\n\nTragic accidents can occur if the operator is not alert to the presence of children. Children are often attracted to the mower and the mowing activity. They do not understand the dangers. Never assume that children will remain where you last saw them.\n\n1. Keep children out of the mowing area and under watchful care of a responsible adult other than the operator.\n2. Be alert and turn mower off if a child enters the area.\n3. Before and while moving backwards, look behind and down for small children.\n4. Use extreme care when approaching blind corners, doorways, shrubs, trees, or other objects that may block your vision of a child who may run into the mower.\n5. Keep children away from hot or running engines. They can suffer burns from a hot muffler.\n6. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and be trained and supervised by an adult.\n\n### Service\n\nSafe Handling of Gasoline\n\nTo avoid personal injury or property damage, use extreme care in handling gasoline. Gasoline is extremely flammable and the vapors are explosive. Serious personal injury can occur when gasoline is spilled on yourself or your clothes, which can ignite. Wash your skin and change clothes immediately.\n\n1. Use only an approved gasoline container.\n2. Never fill containers inside a vehicle or on a truck or trailer bed with a plastic liner. Always place containers on the ground away from your vehicle before filling.\n3. Remove gas-powered equipment from the truck or trailer and refuel it on the ground. If this is not possible, then refuel such equipment on a trailer with a portable container, rather than from a gasoline dispenser nozzle.\n4. Keep the nozzle in contact with the rim of the fuel tank or container opening at all times until fueling is complete. Do not use a nozzle lock-open device.\n5. Extinguish all cigarettes, cigars, pipes and other sources of ignition.\n6. Never fuel machine indoors because flammable vapors will accumulate in the area.\n7. Never remove gas cap or add fuel while the engine is hot or running. Allow engine to cool at least two minutes before refueling.\n8. Never overfill fuel tank. Fill tank to no more than \u00bd inch below bottom of filler neck to provide space for fuel expansion.\n9. Replace gasoline cap and tighten securely.\n10. If gasoline is spilled, wipe it off the engine and equipment. Move machine to another area. Wait 5 minutes before starting engine.\n11. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light (e.g. furnace, water heater, space heater, clothes dryer, etc.).\n12. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n13. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light such as a water heater, furnace, clothes dryer etc.\n14. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n\n---\n\n## General Service\n\n1. Never run an engine indoors or in a poorly ventilated area. Engine exhaust contains carbon monoxide, an odorless and deadly gas.\n2. Before cleaning, repairing, or inspecting, make certain the blade and all moving parts have stopped. Disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine to prevent unintended starting.\n3. Check the blade and engine mounting bolts at frequent intervals for proper tightness. Also, visually inspect blade for damage (e.g., bent, cracked, worn). Replace blade with the original equipment manufacturer\u2019s (O.E.M.) blade only, listed in this manual. \u201cUse of parts which do not meet the original equipment specifications may lead to improper performance and compromise safety!\u201d\n4. Mower blades are sharp and can cut. Wrap the blade or wear gloves, and use extra caution when servicing them.\n5. Keep all nuts, bolts, and screws tight to be sure the equipment is in safe working condition.\n6. Never tamper with safety devices. Check their proper operation regularly.\n7. After striking a foreign object, stop the engine, disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine. Thoroughly inspect the mower for any damage. Repair the damage before starting and operating the mower.\n8. Never attempt to make adjustments or repairs to the mower while the engine is running.\n9. Grass catcher components are subject to wear, damage and deterioration, which could expose moving parts or allow objects to be thrown. Frequently check components and replace with the manufacturer\u2019s recommended parts when necessary.\n10. Mower blades are sharp and can cut. Wrap the blade or wear gloves, and use extra caution when servicing them.\n11. Do not change the engine governor setting or over-speed the engine. The governor controls the maximum safe operating speed of the engine.\n12. Maintain or replace safety and instruction labels, as necessary.\n13. Observe proper disposal laws and regulations for gas, oil, etc. to protect the environment.\n\n### Your Responsibility\n\nRestrict the use of this power machine to persons who read, understand and follow the warnings and instructions in this manual and on the machine.\n\n---\n\n## SAVE THESE INSTRUCTIONS!",

            "### DANGER\n\nThis machine was built to be operated according to the safe operation practices in this manual. As with any type of power equipment, carelessness or error on the part of the operator can result in serious injury. This machine is capable of amputating fingers, hands, toes and feet and throwing objects. Failure to observe the following safety instructions could result in serious injury or death.\n\n### General Operation",
            "1. Read this operator's manual carefully in its entirety before attempting to assemble this machine. Read, understand, and follow all instructions on the machine and in the manual(s) before operation. Keep this manual in a safe place for future and regular reference and for ordering replacement parts.\n2. Be completely familiar with the controls and the proper use of this machine before operating it.\n3. This machine is a precision piece of power equipment, not a plaything. Therefore, exercise extreme caution at all times. This machine has been designed to perform one job: to mow grass. Do not use it for any other purpose.\n4. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and should be trained and supervised by an adult.\n5. Only responsible individuals who are familiar with these rules of safe operation should be allowed to use this machine.\n6. Thoroughly inspect the area where the equipment is to be used. Remove all stones, sticks, wire, bones, toys and other foreign objects, which could be tripped over or picked up and thrown by the blade. Thrown objects can cause serious personal injury.\n7. Plan your mowing pattern to avoid discharge of material toward roads, sidewalks, bystanders and the like. Also, avoid discharging material against a wall or obstruction, which may cause discharged material to ricochet back toward the operator.\n8. To help avoid blade contact or a thrown object injury, stay in operator zone behind handles and keep children, bystanders, helpers and pets at least 75 feet from mower while it is in operation. Stop machine if anyone enters area.\n9. Always wear safety glasses or safety goggles during operation and while performing an adjustment or repair to protect your eyes. Thrown objects which ricochet can cause serious injury to the eyes.\n10. Wear sturdy, rough-soled work shoes and close-fitting slacks and shirts. Shirts and pants that cover the arms and legs and steel-toed shoes are recommended. Never operate this machine in bare feet, sandals, slippery or lightweight (e.g., canvas) shoes.\n11. Do not put hands or feet near rotating parts or under the cutting deck. Contact with blade can amputate fingers, hands, toes and feet.\n12. A missing or damaged discharge cover can cause blade contact or thrown object injuries.\n13. Many injuries occur as a result of the mower being pulled over the foot during a fall caused by slipping or tripping. Do not hold onto the mower if you are falling; release the handle immediately.\n14. Never pull the mower back toward you while you are walking. If you must back the mower away from a wall or obstruction first look down and behind to avoid tripping and then follow these steps:\n    - Step back from mower to fully extend your arms.\n    - Be sure you are well balanced with sure footing.\n    - Pull the mower back slowly, no more than halfway toward you.\n    - Repeat these steps as needed.\n15. Do not operate the mower while under the influence of alcohol or drugs.\n16. Do not engage the self-propelled mechanism on machines so equipped while starting engine.\n17. The blade control is a safety device. Never attempt to bypass its operation. Doing so makes the safety device inoperative and may result in personal injury through contact with the rotating blade. The blade control must operate easily in both directions and automatically return to the disengaged position when released.\n18. Never operate the mower in wet grass. Always be sure of your footing. A slip and fall can cause serious personal injury. If you feel you are losing your footing, release the blade control handle immediately and the blade will stop rotating within three seconds.\n19. Mow only in daylight or good artificial light. Walk, never run.\n20. Stop the blade when crossing gravel drives, walks or roads.\n21. If the equipment should start to vibrate abnormally, stop the engine and check immediately for the cause. Vibration is generally a warning of trouble.\n22. Shut the engine off and wait until the blade comes to a complete stop before removing the grass catcher or unclogging the chute. The cutting blade continues to rotate for a few seconds after the blade control is released. Never place any part of the body in the blade area until you are sure the blade has stopped rotating.\n23. Never operate mower without proper trail shield, discharge cover, grass catcher, blade control or other safety protective devices in place and working. Never operate mower with damaged safety devices. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.\n24. Muffler and engine become hot and can cause a burn. Do not touch.\n25. Never attempt to make a wheel or cutting height adjustment while the engine is running.\n26. Only use parts and accessories made for this machine by the manufacturer. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.",
            "27. When starting engine, pull cord slowly until resistance is felt, then pull rapidly. Rapid retraction of starter cord (kickback) will pull hand and arm toward engine faster than you can let go. Broken bones, fractures, bruises or sprains could result.\n28. If situations occur which are not covered in this manual, use care and good judgment. Contact Customer Support for assistance and the name of your nearest servicing dealer.",
            "### Children\n\nTragic accidents can occur if the operator is not alert to the presence of children. Children are often attracted to the mower and the mowing activity. They do not understand the dangers. Never assume that children will remain where you last saw them.\n\n1. Keep children out of the mowing area and under watchful care of a responsible adult other than the operator.\n2. Be alert and turn mower off if a child enters the area.\n3. Before and while moving backwards, look behind and down for small children.\n4. Use extreme care when approaching blind corners, doorways, shrubs, trees, or other objects that may block your vision of a child who may run into the mower.\n5. Keep children away from hot or running engines. They can suffer burns from a hot muffler.\n6. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and be trained and supervised by an adult.\n\n### Service\n\nSafe Handling of Gasoline\n\nTo avoid personal injury or property damage, use extreme care in handling gasoline. Gasoline is extremely flammable and the vapors are explosive. Serious personal injury can occur when gasoline is spilled on yourself or your clothes, which can ignite. Wash your skin and change clothes immediately.\n\n1. Use only an approved gasoline container.\n2. Never fill containers inside a vehicle or on a truck or trailer bed with a plastic liner. Always place containers on the ground away from your vehicle before filling.\n3. Remove gas-powered equipment from the truck or trailer and refuel it on the ground. If this is not possible, then refuel such equipment on a trailer with a portable container, rather than from a gasoline dispenser nozzle.\n4. Keep the nozzle in contact with the rim of the fuel tank or container opening at all times until fueling is complete. Do not use a nozzle lock-open device.\n5. Extinguish all cigarettes, cigars, pipes and other sources of ignition.\n6. Never fuel machine indoors because flammable vapors will accumulate in the area.\n7. Never remove gas cap or add fuel while the engine is hot or running. Allow engine to cool at least two minutes before refueling.\n8. Never overfill fuel tank. Fill tank to no more than \u00bd inch below bottom of filler neck to provide space for fuel expansion.\n9. Replace gasoline cap and tighten securely.\n10. If gasoline is spilled, wipe it off the engine and equipment. Move machine to another area. Wait 5 minutes before starting engine.\n11. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light (e.g. furnace, water heater, space heater, clothes dryer, etc.).\n12. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n13. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light such as a water heater, furnace, clothes dryer etc.\n14. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n\n---\n\n## General Service\n\n1. Never run an engine indoors or in a poorly ventilated area. Engine exhaust contains carbon monoxide, an odorless and deadly gas.\n2. Before cleaning, repairing, or inspecting, make certain the blade and all moving parts have stopped. Disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine to prevent unintended starting.\n3. Check the blade and engine mounting bolts at frequent intervals for proper tightness. Also, visually inspect blade for damage (e.g., bent, cracked, worn). Replace blade with the original equipment manufacturer\u2019s (O.E.M.) blade only, listed in this manual. \u201cUse of parts which do not meet the original equipment specifications may lead to improper performance and compromise safety!\u201d\n4. Mower blades are sharp and can cut. Wrap the blade or wear gloves, and use extra caution when servicing them.\n5. Keep all nuts, bolts, and screws tight to be sure the equipment is in safe working condition.\n6. Never tamper with safety devices. Check their proper operation regularly.\n7. After striking a foreign object, stop the engine, disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine. Thoroughly inspect the mower for any damage. Repair the damage before starting and operating the mower.\n8. Never attempt to make adjustments or repairs to the mower while the engine is running.\n9. Grass catcher components are subject to wear, damage and deterioration, which could expose moving parts or allow objects to be thrown. Frequently check components and replace with the manufacturer\u2019s recommended parts when necessary.\n10. Mower blades are sharp and can cut. Wrap the blade or wear gloves, and use extra caution when servicing them.\n11. Do not change the engine governor setting or over-speed the engine. The governor controls the maximum safe operating speed of the engine.\n12. Maintain or replace safety and instruction labels, as necessary.\n13. Observe proper disposal laws and regulations for gas, oil, etc. to protect the environment.\n\n### Your Responsibility\n\nRestrict the use of this power machine to persons who read, understand and follow the warnings and instructions in this manual and on the machine.\n\n---\n\n## SAVE THESE INSTRUCTIONS!",

            "### DANGER\n\nThis machine was built to be operated according to the safe operation practices in this manual. As with any type of power equipment, carelessness or error on the part of the operator can result in serious injury. This machine is capable of amputating fingers, hands, toes and feet and throwing objects. Failure to observe the following safety instructions could result in serious injury or death.\n\n### General Operation",
            "1. Read this operator's manual carefully in its entirety before attempting to assemble this machine. Read, understand, and follow all instructions on the machine and in the manual(s) before operation. Keep this manual in a safe place for future and regular reference and for ordering replacement parts.\n2. Be completely familiar with the controls and the proper use of this machine before operating it.\n3. This machine is a precision piece of power equipment, not a plaything. Therefore, exercise extreme caution at all times. This machine has been designed to perform one job: to mow grass. Do not use it for any other purpose.\n4. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and should be trained and supervised by an adult.\n5. Only responsible individuals who are familiar with these rules of safe operation should be allowed to use this machine.\n6. Thoroughly inspect the area where the equipment is to be used. Remove all stones, sticks, wire, bones, toys and other foreign objects, which could be tripped over or picked up and thrown by the blade. Thrown objects can cause serious personal injury.\n7. Plan your mowing pattern to avoid discharge of material toward roads, sidewalks, bystanders and the like. Also, avoid discharging material against a wall or obstruction, which may cause discharged material to ricochet back toward the operator.\n8. To help avoid blade contact or a thrown object injury, stay in operator zone behind handles and keep children, bystanders, helpers and pets at least 75 feet from mower while it is in operation. Stop machine if anyone enters area.\n9. Always wear safety glasses or safety goggles during operation and while performing an adjustment or repair to protect your eyes. Thrown objects which ricochet can cause serious injury to the eyes.\n10. Wear sturdy, rough-soled work shoes and close-fitting slacks and shirts. Shirts and pants that cover the arms and legs and steel-toed shoes are recommended. Never operate this machine in bare feet, sandals, slippery or lightweight (e.g., canvas) shoes.\n11. Do not put hands or feet near rotating parts or under the cutting deck. Contact with blade can amputate fingers, hands, toes and feet.\n12. A missing or damaged discharge cover can cause blade contact or thrown object injuries.\n13. Many injuries occur as a result of the mower being pulled over the foot during a fall caused by slipping or tripping. Do not hold onto the mower if you are falling; release the handle immediately.\n14. Never pull the mower back toward you while you are walking. If you must back the mower away from a wall or obstruction first look down and behind to avoid tripping and then follow these steps:\n    - Step back from mower to fully extend your arms.\n    - Be sure you are well balanced with sure footing.\n    - Pull the mower back slowly, no more than halfway toward you.\n    - Repeat these steps as needed.\n15. Do not operate the mower while under the influence of alcohol or drugs.\n16. Do not engage the self-propelled mechanism on machines so equipped while starting engine.\n17. The blade control is a safety device. Never attempt to bypass its operation. Doing so makes the safety device inoperative and may result in personal injury through contact with the rotating blade. The blade control must operate easily in both directions and automatically return to the disengaged position when released.\n18. Never operate the mower in wet grass. Always be sure of your footing. A slip and fall can cause serious personal injury. If you feel you are losing your footing, release the blade control handle immediately and the blade will stop rotating within three seconds.\n19. Mow only in daylight or good artificial light. Walk, never run.\n20. Stop the blade when crossing gravel drives, walks or roads.\n21. If the equipment should start to vibrate abnormally, stop the engine and check immediately for the cause. Vibration is generally a warning of trouble.\n22. Shut the engine off and wait until the blade comes to a complete stop before removing the grass catcher or unclogging the chute. The cutting blade continues to rotate for a few seconds after the blade control is released. Never place any part of the body in the blade area until you are sure the blade has stopped rotating.\n23. Never operate mower without proper trail shield, discharge cover, grass catcher, blade control or other safety protective devices in place and working. Never operate mower with damaged safety devices. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.\n24. Muffler and engine become hot and can cause a burn. Do not touch.\n25. Never attempt to make a wheel or cutting height adjustment while the engine is running.\n26. Only use parts and accessories made for this machine by the manufacturer. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.",
            "27. When starting engine, pull cord slowly until resistance is felt, then pull rapidly. Rapid retraction of starter cord (kickback) will pull hand and arm toward engine faster than you can let go. Broken bones, fractures, bruises or sprains could result.\n28. If situations occur which are not covered in this manual, use care and good judgment. Contact Customer Support for assistance and the name of your nearest servicing dealer.",
            "### Children\n\nTragic accidents can occur if the operator is not alert to the presence of children. Children are often attracted to the mower and the mowing activity. They do not understand the dangers. Never assume that children will remain where you last saw them.\n\n1. Keep children out of the mowing area and under watchful care of a responsible adult other than the operator.\n2. Be alert and turn mower off if a child enters the area.\n3. Before and while moving backwards, look behind and down for small children.\n4. Use extreme care when approaching blind corners, doorways, shrubs, trees, or other objects that may block your vision of a child who may run into the mower.\n5. Keep children away from hot or running engines. They can suffer burns from a hot muffler.\n6. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and be trained and supervised by an adult.\n\n### Service\n\nSafe Handling of Gasoline\n\nTo avoid personal injury or property damage, use extreme care in handling gasoline. Gasoline is extremely flammable and the vapors are explosive. Serious personal injury can occur when gasoline is spilled on yourself or your clothes, which can ignite. Wash your skin and change clothes immediately.\n\n1. Use only an approved gasoline container.\n2. Never fill containers inside a vehicle or on a truck or trailer bed with a plastic liner. Always place containers on the ground away from your vehicle before filling.\n3. Remove gas-powered equipment from the truck or trailer and refuel it on the ground. If this is not possible, then refuel such equipment on a trailer with a portable container, rather than from a gasoline dispenser nozzle.\n4. Keep the nozzle in contact with the rim of the fuel tank or container opening at all times until fueling is complete. Do not use a nozzle lock-open device.\n5. Extinguish all cigarettes, cigars, pipes and other sources of ignition.\n6. Never fuel machine indoors because flammable vapors will accumulate in the area.\n7. Never remove gas cap or add fuel while the engine is hot or running. Allow engine to cool at least two minutes before refueling.\n8. Never overfill fuel tank. Fill tank to no more than \u00bd inch below bottom of filler neck to provide space for fuel expansion.\n9. Replace gasoline cap and tighten securely.\n10. If gasoline is spilled, wipe it off the engine and equipment. Move machine to another area. Wait 5 minutes before starting engine.\n11. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light (e.g. furnace, water heater, space heater, clothes dryer, etc.).\n12. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n13. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light such as a water heater, furnace, clothes dryer etc.\n14. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n\n---\n\n## General Service\n\n1. Never run an engine indoors or in a poorly ventilated area. Engine exhaust contains carbon monoxide, an odorless and deadly gas.\n2. Before cleaning, repairing, or inspecting, make certain the blade and all moving parts have stopped. Disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine to prevent unintended starting.\n3. Check the blade and engine mounting bolts at frequent intervals for proper tightness. Also, visually inspect blade for damage (e.g., bent, cracked, worn). Replace blade with the original equipment manufacturer\u2019s (O.E.M.) blade only, listed in this manual. \u201cUse of parts which do not meet the original equipment specifications may lead to improper performance and compromise safety!\u201d\n4. Mower blades are sharp and can cut. Wrap the blade or wear gloves, and use extra caution when servicing them.\n5. Keep all nuts, bolts, and screws tight to be sure the equipment is in safe working condition.\n6. Never tamper with safety devices. Check their proper operation regularly.\n7. After striking a foreign object, stop the engine, disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine. Thoroughly inspect the mower for any damage. Repair the damage before starting and operating the mower.\n8. Never attempt to make adjustments or repairs to the mower while the engine is running.\n9. Grass catcher components are subject to wear, damage and deterioration, which could expose moving parts or allow objects to be thrown. Frequently check components and replace with the manufacturer\u2019s recommended parts when necessary.\n10. Mower blades are sharp and can cut. Wrap the blade or wear gloves, and use extra caution when servicing them.\n11. Do not change the engine governor setting or over-speed the engine.

            "### DANGER\n\nThis machine was built to be operated according to the safe operation practices in this manual. As with any type of power equipment, carelessness or error on the part of the operator can result in serious injury. This machine is capable of amputating fingers, hands, toes and feet and throwing objects. Failure to observe the following safety instructions could result in serious injury or death.\n\n### General Operation",
            "1. Read this operator's manual carefully in its entirety before attempting to assemble this machine. Read, understand, and follow all instructions on the machine and in the manual(s) before operation. Keep this manual in a safe place for future and regular reference and for ordering replacement parts.\n2. Be completely familiar with the controls and the proper use of this machine before operating it.\n3. This machine is a precision piece of power equipment, not a plaything. Therefore, exercise extreme caution at all times. This machine has been designed to perform one job: to mow grass. Do not use it for any other purpose.\n4. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and should be trained and supervised by an adult.\n5. Only responsible individuals who are familiar with these rules of safe operation should be allowed to use this machine.\n6. Thoroughly inspect the area where the equipment is to be used. Remove all stones, sticks, wire, bones, toys and other foreign objects, which could be tripped over or picked up and thrown by the blade. Thrown objects can cause serious personal injury.\n7. Plan your mowing pattern to avoid discharge of material toward roads, sidewalks, bystanders and the like. Also, avoid discharging material against a wall or obstruction, which may cause discharged material to ricochet back toward the operator.\n8. To help avoid blade contact or a thrown object injury, stay in operator zone behind handles and keep children, bystanders, helpers and pets at least 75 feet from mower while it is in operation. Stop machine if anyone enters area.\n9. Always wear safety glasses or safety goggles during operation and while performing an adjustment or repair to protect your eyes. Thrown objects which ricochet can cause serious injury to the eyes.\n10. Wear sturdy, rough-soled work shoes and close-fitting slacks and shirts. Shirts and pants that cover the arms and legs and steel-toed shoes are recommended. Never operate this machine in bare feet, sandals, slippery or lightweight (e.g., canvas) shoes.\n11. Do not put hands or feet near rotating parts or under the cutting deck. Contact with blade can amputate fingers, hands, toes and feet.\n12. A missing or damaged discharge cover can cause blade contact or thrown object injuries.\n13. Many injuries occur as a result of the mower being pulled over the foot during a fall caused by slipping or tripping. Do not hold onto the mower if you are falling; release the handle immediately.\n14. Never pull the mower back toward you while you are walking. If you must back the mower away from a wall or obstruction first look down and behind to avoid tripping and then follow these steps:\n    - Step back from mower to fully extend your arms.\n    - Be sure you are well balanced with sure footing.\n    - Pull the mower back slowly, no more than halfway toward you.\n    - Repeat these steps as needed.\n15. Do not operate the mower while under the influence of alcohol or drugs.\n16. Do not engage the self-propelled mechanism on machines so equipped while starting engine.\n17. The blade control is a safety device. Never attempt to bypass its operation. Doing so makes the safety device inoperative and may result in personal injury through contact with the rotating blade. The blade control must operate easily in both directions and automatically return to the disengaged position when released.\n18. Never operate the mower in wet grass. Always be sure of your footing. A slip and fall can cause serious personal injury. If you feel you are losing your footing, release the blade control handle immediately and the blade will stop rotating within three seconds.\n19. Mow only in daylight or good artificial light. Walk, never run.\n20. Stop the blade when crossing gravel drives, walks or roads.\n21. If the equipment should start to vibrate abnormally, stop the engine and check immediately for the cause. Vibration is generally a warning of trouble.\n22. Shut the engine off and wait until the blade comes to a complete stop before removing the grass catcher or unclogging the chute. The cutting blade continues to rotate for a few seconds after the blade control is released. Never place any part of the body in the blade area until you are sure the blade has stopped rotating.\n23. Never operate mower without proper trail shield, discharge cover, grass catcher, blade control or other safety protective devices in place and working. Never operate mower with damaged safety devices. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.\n24. Muffler and engine become hot and can cause a burn. Do not touch.\n25. Never attempt to make a wheel or cutting height adjustment while the engine is running.\n26. Only use parts and accessories made for this machine by the manufacturer. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.",
            "27. When starting engine, pull cord slowly until resistance is felt, then pull rapidly. Rapid retraction of starter cord (kickback) will pull hand and arm toward engine faster than you can let go. Broken bones, fractures, bruises or sprains could result.\n28. If situations occur which are not covered in this manual, use care and good judgment. Contact Customer Support for assistance and the name of your nearest servicing dealer.",
            "### Children\n\nTragic accidents can occur if the operator is not alert to the presence of children. Children are often attracted to the mower and the mowing activity. They do not understand the dangers. Never assume that children will remain where you last saw them.\n\n1. Keep children out of the mowing area and under watchful care of a responsible adult other than the operator.\n2. Be alert and turn mower off if a child enters the area.\n3. Before and while moving backwards, look behind and down for small children.\n4. Use extreme care when approaching blind corners, doorways, shrubs, trees, or other objects that may block your vision of a child who may run into the mower.\n5. Keep children away from hot or running engines. They can suffer burns from a hot muffler.\n6. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and be trained and supervised by an adult.\n\n### Service\n\nSafe Handling of Gasoline\n\nTo avoid personal injury or property damage, use extreme care in handling gasoline. Gasoline is extremely flammable and the vapors are explosive. Serious personal injury can occur when gasoline is spilled on yourself or your clothes, which can ignite. Wash your skin and change clothes immediately.\n\n1. Use only an approved gasoline container.\n2. Never fill containers inside a vehicle or on a truck or trailer bed with a plastic liner. Always place containers on the ground away from your vehicle before filling.\n3. Remove gas-powered equipment from the truck or trailer and refuel it on the ground. If this is not possible, then refuel such equipment on a trailer with a portable container, rather than from a gasoline dispenser nozzle.\n4. Keep the nozzle in contact with the rim of the fuel tank or container opening at all times until fueling is complete. Do not use a nozzle lock-open device.\n5. Extinguish all cigarettes, cigars, pipes and other sources of ignition.\n6. Never fuel machine indoors because flammable vapors will accumulate in the area.\n7. Never remove gas cap or add fuel while the engine is hot or running. Allow engine to cool at least two minutes before refueling.\n8. Never overfill fuel tank. Fill tank to no more than \u00bd inch below bottom of filler neck to provide space for fuel expansion.\n9. Replace gasoline cap and tighten securely.\n10. If gasoline is spilled, wipe it off the engine and equipment. Move machine to another area. Wait 5 minutes before starting engine.\n11. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light (e.g. furnace, water heater, space heater, clothes dryer, etc.).\n12. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n13. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light such as a water heater, furnace, clothes dryer etc.\n14. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n\n---\n\n## General Service\n\n1. Never run an engine indoors or in a poorly ventilated area. Engine exhaust contains carbon monoxide, an odorless and deadly gas.\n2. Before cleaning, repairing, or inspecting, make certain the blade and all moving parts have stopped. Disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine to prevent unintended starting.\n3. Check the blade and engine mounting bolts at frequent intervals for proper tightness. Also, visually inspect blade for damage (e.g., bent, cracked, worn). Replace blade with the original equipment manufacturer\u2019s (O.E.M.) blade only, listed in this manual. \u201cUse of parts which do not meet the original equipment specifications may lead to improper performance and compromise safety!\u201d\n4. Mower blades are sharp and can cut. Wrap the blade or wear gloves, and use extra caution when servicing them.\n5. Keep all nuts, bolts, and screws tight to be sure the equipment is in safe working condition.\n6. Never tamper with safety devices. Check their proper operation regularly.\n7. After striking a foreign object, stop the engine, disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine. Thoroughly inspect the mower for any damage. Repair the damage before starting and operating the mower.\n8. Never attempt to make adjustments or repairs to the mower while the engine is running.\n9. Grass catcher components are subject to wear, damage and deterioration, which could expose moving parts or allow objects to be thrown. Frequently check components and replace with the manufacturer\u2019s recommended parts when necessary.\n10. Mower blades are sharp and can cut.

            "### DANGER\n\nThis machine was built to be operated according to the safe operation practices in this manual. As with any type of power equipment, carelessness or error on the part of the operator can result in serious injury. This machine is capable of amputating fingers, hands, toes and feet and throwing objects. Failure to observe the following safety instructions could result in serious injury or death.\n\n### General Operation",
            "1. Read this operator's manual carefully in its entirety before attempting to assemble this machine. Read, understand, and follow all instructions on the machine and in the manual(s) before operation. Keep this manual in a safe place for future and regular reference and for ordering replacement parts.\n2. Be completely familiar with the controls and the proper use of this machine before operating it.\n3. This machine is a precision piece of power equipment, not a plaything. Therefore, exercise extreme caution at all times. This machine has been designed to perform one job: to mow grass. Do not use it for any other purpose.\n4. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and should be trained and supervised by an adult.\n5. Only responsible individuals who are familiar with these rules of safe operation should be allowed to use this machine.\n6. Thoroughly inspect the area where the equipment is to be used. Remove all stones, sticks, wire, bones, toys and other foreign objects, which could be tripped over or picked up and thrown by the blade. Thrown objects can cause serious personal injury.\n7. Plan your mowing pattern to avoid discharge of material toward roads, sidewalks, bystanders and the like. Also, avoid discharging material against a wall or obstruction, which may cause discharged material to ricochet back toward the operator.\n8. To help avoid blade contact or a thrown object injury, stay in operator zone behind handles and keep children, bystanders, helpers and pets at least 75 feet from mower while it is in operation. Stop machine if anyone enters area.\n9. Always wear safety glasses or safety goggles during operation and while performing an adjustment or repair to protect your eyes. Thrown objects which ricochet can cause serious injury to the eyes.\n10. Wear sturdy, rough-soled work shoes and close-fitting slacks and shirts. Shirts and pants that cover the arms and legs and steel-toed shoes are recommended. Never operate this machine in bare feet, sandals, slippery or lightweight (e.g., canvas) shoes.\n11. Do not put hands or feet near rotating parts or under the cutting deck. Contact with blade can amputate fingers, hands, toes and feet.\n12. A missing or damaged discharge cover can cause blade contact or thrown object injuries.\n13. Many injuries occur as a result of the mower being pulled over the foot during a fall caused by slipping or tripping. Do not hold onto the mower if you are falling; release the handle immediately.\n14. Never pull the mower back toward you while you are walking. If you must back the mower away from a wall or obstruction first look down and behind to avoid tripping and then follow these steps:\n    - Step back from mower to fully extend your arms.\n    - Be sure you are well balanced with sure footing.\n    - Pull the mower back slowly, no more than halfway toward you.\n    - Repeat these steps as needed.\n15. Do not operate the mower while under the influence of alcohol or drugs.\n16. Do not engage the self-propelled mechanism on machines so equipped while starting engine.\n17. The blade control is a safety device. Never attempt to bypass its operation. Doing so makes the safety device inoperative and may result in personal injury through contact with the rotating blade. The blade control must operate easily in both directions and automatically return to the disengaged position when released.\n18. Never operate the mower in wet grass. Always be sure of your footing. A slip and fall can cause serious personal injury. If you feel you are losing your footing, release the blade control handle immediately and the blade will stop rotating within three seconds.\n19. Mow only in daylight or good artificial light. Walk, never run.\n20. Stop the blade when crossing gravel drives, walks or roads.\n21. If the equipment should start to vibrate abnormally, stop the engine and check immediately for the cause. Vibration is generally a warning of trouble.\n22. Shut the engine off and wait until the blade comes to a complete stop before removing the grass catcher or unclogging the chute. The cutting blade continues to rotate for a few seconds after the blade control is released. Never place any part of the body in the blade area until you are sure the blade has stopped rotating.\n23. Never operate mower without proper trail shield, discharge cover, grass catcher, blade control or other safety protective devices in place and working. Never operate mower with damaged safety devices. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.\n24. Muffler and engine become hot and can cause a burn. Do not touch.\n25. Never attempt to make a wheel or cutting height adjustment while the engine is running.\n26. Only use parts and accessories made for this machine by the manufacturer. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.",
            "27. When starting engine, pull cord slowly until resistance is felt, then pull rapidly. Rapid retraction of starter cord (kickback) will pull hand and arm toward engine faster than you can let go. Broken bones, fractures, bruises or sprains could result.\n28. If situations occur which are not covered in this manual, use care and good judgment. Contact Customer Support for assistance and the name of your nearest servicing dealer.",
            "### Children\n\nTragic accidents can occur if the operator is not alert to the presence of children. Children are often attracted to the mower and the mowing activity. They do not understand the dangers. Never assume that children will remain where you last saw them.\n\n1. Keep children out of the mowing area and under watchful care of a responsible adult other than the operator.\n2. Be alert and turn mower off if a child enters the area.\n3. Before and while moving backwards, look behind and down for small children.\n4. Use extreme care when approaching blind corners, doorways, shrubs, trees, or other objects that may block your vision of a child who may run into the mower.\n5. Keep children away from hot or running engines. They can suffer burns from a hot muffler.\n6. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and be trained and supervised by an adult.\n\n### Service\n\nSafe Handling of Gasoline\n\nTo avoid personal injury or property damage, use extreme care in handling gasoline. Gasoline is extremely flammable and the vapors are explosive. Serious personal injury can occur when gasoline is spilled on yourself or your clothes, which can ignite. Wash your skin and change clothes immediately.\n\n1. Use only an approved gasoline container.\n2. Never fill containers inside a vehicle or on a truck or trailer bed with a plastic liner. Always place containers on the ground away from your vehicle before filling.\n3. Remove gas-powered equipment from the truck or trailer and refuel it on the ground. If this is not possible, then refuel such equipment on a trailer with a portable container, rather than from a gasoline dispenser nozzle.\n4. Keep the nozzle in contact with the rim of the fuel tank or container opening at all times until fueling is complete. Do not use a nozzle lock-open device.\n5. Extinguish all cigarettes, cigars, pipes and other sources of ignition.\n6. Never fuel machine indoors because flammable vapors will accumulate in the area.\n7. Never remove gas cap or add fuel while the engine is hot or running. Allow engine to cool at least two minutes before refueling.\n8. Never overfill fuel tank. Fill tank to no more than \u00bd inch below bottom of filler neck to provide space for fuel expansion.\n9. Replace gasoline cap and tighten securely.\n10. If gasoline is spilled, wipe it off the engine and equipment. Move machine to another area. Wait 5 minutes before starting engine.\n11. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light (e.g. furnace, water heater, space heater, clothes dryer, etc.).\n12. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n13. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light such as a water heater, furnace, clothes dryer etc.\n14. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n\n---\n\n## General Service\n\n1. Never run an engine indoors or in a poorly ventilated area. Engine exhaust contains carbon monoxide, an odorless and deadly gas.\n2. Before cleaning, repairing, or inspecting, make certain the blade and all moving parts have stopped. Disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine to prevent unintended starting.\n3. Check the blade and engine mounting bolts at frequent intervals for proper tightness. Also, visually inspect blade for damage (e.g., bent, cracked, worn). Replace blade with the original equipment manufacturer\u2019s (O.E.M.) blade only, listed in this manual. \u201cUse of parts which do not meet the original equipment specifications may lead to improper performance and compromise safety!\u201d\n4. Mower blades are sharp and can cut. Wrap the blade or wear gloves, and use extra caution when servicing them.\n5. Keep all nuts, bolts, and screws tight to be sure the equipment is in safe working condition.\n6. Never tamper with safety devices. Check their proper operation regularly.\n7. After striking a foreign object, stop the engine, disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine. Thoroughly inspect the mower for any damage. Repair the damage before starting and operating the mower.\n8. Never attempt to make adjustments or repairs to the mower while the engine is running.\n9. Grass catcher components are subject to wear, damage and deterioration, which could expose moving parts or allow objects to be thrown. Frequently check components and replace with the manufacturer\u2019s recommended parts when necessary.\n10. Mower blades are sharp and can cut. Wrap the blade or wear gloves, and use extra caution when servicing them.\n11. Do not change the engine governor setting or over-speed the engine.

            "### DANGER\n\nThis machine was built to be operated according to the safe operation practices in this manual. As with any type of power equipment, carelessness or error on the part of the operator can result in serious injury. This machine is capable of amputating fingers, hands, toes and feet and throwing objects. Failure to observe the following safety instructions could result in serious injury or death.\n\n### General Operation",
            "1. Read this operator's manual carefully in its entirety before attempting to assemble this machine. Read, understand, and follow all instructions on the machine and in the manual(s) before operation. Keep this manual in a safe place for future and regular reference and for ordering replacement parts.\n2. Be completely familiar with the controls and the proper use of this machine before operating it.\n3. This machine is a precision piece of power equipment, not a plaything. Therefore, exercise extreme caution at all times. This machine has been designed to perform one job: to mow grass. Do not use it for any other purpose.\n4. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and should be trained and supervised by an adult.\n5. Only responsible individuals who are familiar with these rules of safe operation should be allowed to use this machine.\n6. Thoroughly inspect the area where the equipment is to be used. Remove all stones, sticks, wire, bones, toys and other foreign objects, which could be tripped over or picked up and thrown by the blade. Thrown objects can cause serious personal injury.\n7. Plan your mowing pattern to avoid discharge of material toward roads, sidewalks, bystanders and the like. Also, avoid discharging material against a wall or obstruction, which may cause discharged material to ricochet back toward the operator.\n8. To help avoid blade contact or a thrown object injury, stay in operator zone behind handles and keep children, bystanders, helpers and pets at least 75 feet from mower while it is in operation. Stop machine if anyone enters area.\n9. Always wear safety glasses or safety goggles during operation and while performing an adjustment or repair to protect your eyes. Thrown objects which ricochet can cause serious injury to the eyes.\n10. Wear sturdy, rough-soled work shoes and close-fitting slacks and shirts. Shirts and pants that cover the arms and legs and steel-toed shoes are recommended. Never operate this machine in bare feet, sandals, slippery or lightweight (e.g., canvas) shoes.\n11. Do not put hands or feet near rotating parts or under the cutting deck. Contact with blade can amputate fingers, hands, toes and feet.\n12. A missing or damaged discharge cover can cause blade contact or thrown object injuries.\n13. Many injuries occur as a result of the mower being pulled over the foot during a fall caused by slipping or tripping. Do not hold onto the mower if you are falling; release the handle immediately.\n14. Never pull the mower back toward you while you are walking. If you must back the mower away from a wall or obstruction first look down and behind to avoid tripping and then follow these steps:\n    - Step back from mower to fully extend your arms.\n    - Be sure you are well balanced with sure footing.\n    - Pull the mower back slowly, no more than halfway toward you.\n    - Repeat these steps as needed.\n15. Do not operate the mower while under the influence of alcohol or drugs.\n16. Do not engage the self-propelled mechanism on machines so equipped while starting engine.\n17. The blade control is a safety device. Never attempt to bypass its operation. Doing so makes the safety device inoperative and may result in personal injury through contact with the rotating blade. The blade control must operate easily in both directions and automatically return to the disengaged position when released.\n18. Never operate the mower in wet grass. Always be sure of your footing. A slip and fall can cause serious personal injury. If you feel you are losing your footing, release the blade control handle immediately and the blade will stop rotating within three seconds.\n19. Mow only in daylight or good artificial light. Walk, never run.\n20. Stop the blade when crossing gravel drives, walks or roads.\n21. If the equipment should start to vibrate abnormally, stop the engine and check immediately for the cause. Vibration is generally a warning of trouble.\n22. Shut the engine off and wait until the blade comes to a complete stop before removing the grass catcher or unclogging the chute. The cutting blade continues to rotate for a few seconds after the blade control is released. Never place any part of the body in the blade area until you are sure the blade has stopped rotating.\n23. Never operate mower without proper trail shield, discharge cover, grass catcher, blade control or other safety protective devices in place and working. Never operate mower with damaged safety devices. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.\n24. Muffler and engine become hot and can cause a burn. Do not touch.\n25. Never attempt to make a wheel or cutting height adjustment while the engine is running.\n26. Only use parts and accessories made for this machine by the manufacturer. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.",
            "27. When starting engine, pull cord slowly until resistance is felt, then pull rapidly. Rapid retraction of starter cord (kickback) will pull hand and arm toward engine faster than you can let go. Broken bones, fractures, bruises or sprains could result.\n28. If situations occur which are not covered in this manual, use care and good judgment. Contact Customer Support for assistance and the name of your nearest servicing dealer.",
            "### Children\n\nTragic accidents can occur if the operator is not alert to the presence of children. Children are often attracted to the mower and the mowing activity. They do not understand the dangers. Never assume that children will remain where you last saw them.\n\n1. Keep children out of the mowing area and under watchful care of a responsible adult other than the operator.\n2. Be alert and turn mower off if a child enters the area.\n3. Before and while moving backwards, look behind and down for small children.\n4. Use extreme care when approaching blind corners, doorways, shrubs, trees, or other objects that may block your vision of a child who may run into the mower.\n5. Keep children away from hot or running engines. They can suffer burns from a hot muffler.\n6. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and be trained and supervised by an adult.\n\n### Service\n\nSafe Handling of Gasoline\n\nTo avoid personal injury or property damage, use extreme care in handling gasoline. Gasoline is extremely flammable and the vapors are explosive. Serious personal injury can occur when gasoline is spilled on yourself or your clothes, which can ignite. Wash your skin and change clothes immediately.\n\n1. Use only an approved gasoline container.\n2. Never fill containers inside a vehicle or on a truck or trailer bed with a plastic liner. Always place containers on the ground away from your vehicle before filling.\n3. Remove gas-powered equipment from the truck or trailer and refuel it on the ground. If this is not possible, then refuel such equipment on a trailer with a portable container, rather than from a gasoline dispenser nozzle.\n4. Keep the nozzle in contact with the rim of the fuel tank or container opening at all times until fueling is complete. Do not use a nozzle lock-open device.\n5. Extinguish all cigarettes, cigars, pipes and other sources of ignition.\n6. Never fuel machine indoors because flammable vapors will accumulate in the area.\n7. Never remove gas cap or add fuel while the engine is hot or running. Allow engine to cool at least two minutes before refueling.\n8. Never overfill fuel tank. Fill tank to no more than \u00bd inch below bottom of filler neck to provide space for fuel expansion.\n9. Replace gasoline cap and tighten securely.\n10. If gasoline is spilled, wipe it off the engine and equipment. Move machine to another area. Wait 5 minutes before starting engine.\n11. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light (e.g. furnace, water heater, space heater, clothes dryer, etc.).\n12. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n13. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light such as a water heater, furnace, clothes dryer etc.\n14. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n\n---\n\n## General Service\n\n1. Never run an engine indoors or in a poorly ventilated area. Engine exhaust contains carbon monoxide, an odorless and deadly gas.\n2. Before cleaning, repairing, or inspecting, make certain the blade and all moving parts have stopped. Disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine to prevent unintended starting.\n3. Check the blade and engine mounting bolts at frequent intervals for proper tightness. Also, visually inspect blade for damage (e.g., bent, cracked, worn). Replace blade with the original equipment manufacturer\u2019s (O.E.M.) blade only, listed in this manual. \u201cUse of parts which do not meet the original equipment specifications may lead to improper performance and compromise safety!\u201d\n4. Mower blades are sharp and can cut. Wrap the blade or wear gloves, and use extra caution when servicing them.\n5. Keep all nuts, bolts, and screws tight to be sure the equipment is in safe working condition.\n6. Never tamper with safety devices. Check their proper operation regularly.\n7. After striking a foreign object, stop the engine, disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine. Thoroughly inspect the mower for any damage. Repair the damage before starting and operating the mower.\n8. Never attempt to make adjustments or repairs to the mower while the engine is running.\n9. Grass catcher components are subject to wear, damage and deterioration, which could expose moving parts or allow objects to be thrown. Frequently check components and replace with the manufacturer\u2019s recommended parts when necessary.\n10. Mower blades are sharp and can cut. Wrap the blade or wear gloves, and use extra caution when servicing them.\n11. Do not change the engine governor setting or over-speed the engine.

            "### DANGER\n\nThis machine was built to be operated according to the safe operation practices in this manual. As with any type of power equipment, carelessness or error on the part of the operator can result in serious injury. This machine is capable of amputating fingers, hands, toes and feet and throwing objects. Failure to observe the following safety instructions could result in serious injury or death.\n\n### General Operation",
            "1. Read this operator's manual carefully in its entirety before attempting to assemble this machine. Read, understand, and follow all instructions on the machine and in the manual(s) before operation. Keep this manual in a safe place for future and regular reference and for ordering replacement parts.\n2. Be completely familiar with the controls and the proper use of this machine before operating it.\n3. This machine is a precision piece of power equipment, not a plaything. Therefore, exercise extreme caution at all times. This machine has been designed to perform one job: to mow grass. Do not use it for any other purpose.\n4. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and should be trained and supervised by an adult.\n5. Only responsible individuals who are familiar with these rules of safe operation should be allowed to use this machine.\n6. Thoroughly inspect the area where the equipment is to be used. Remove all stones, sticks, wire, bones, toys and other foreign objects, which could be tripped over or picked up and thrown by the blade. Thrown objects can cause serious personal injury.\n7. Plan your mowing pattern to avoid discharge of material toward roads, sidewalks, bystanders and the like. Also, avoid discharging material against a wall or obstruction, which may cause discharged material to ricochet back toward the operator.\n8. To help avoid blade contact or a thrown object injury, stay in operator zone behind handles and keep children, bystanders, helpers and pets at least 75 feet from mower while it is in operation. Stop machine if anyone enters area.\n9. Always wear safety glasses or safety goggles during operation and while performing an adjustment or repair to protect your eyes. Thrown objects which ricochet can cause serious injury to the eyes.\n10. Wear sturdy, rough-soled work shoes and close-fitting slacks and shirts. Shirts and pants that cover the arms and legs and steel-toed shoes are recommended. Never operate this machine in bare feet, sandals, slippery or lightweight (e.g., canvas) shoes.\n11. Do not put hands or feet near rotating parts or under the cutting deck. Contact with blade can amputate fingers, hands, toes and feet.\n12. A missing or damaged discharge cover can cause blade contact or thrown object injuries.\n13. Many injuries occur as a result of the mower being pulled over the foot during a fall caused by slipping or tripping. Do not hold onto the mower if you are falling; release the handle immediately.\n14. Never pull the mower back toward you while you are walking. If you must back the mower away from a wall or obstruction first look down and behind to avoid tripping and then follow these steps:\n    - Step back from mower to fully extend your arms.\n    - Be sure you are well balanced with sure footing.\n    - Pull the mower back slowly, no more than halfway toward you.\n    - Repeat these steps as needed.\n15. Do not operate the mower while under the influence of alcohol or drugs.\n16. Do not engage the self-propelled mechanism on machines so equipped while starting engine.\n17. The blade control is a safety device. Never attempt to bypass its operation. Doing so makes the safety device inoperative and may result in personal injury through contact with the rotating blade. The blade control must operate easily in both directions and automatically return to the disengaged position when released.\n18. Never operate the mower in wet grass. Always be sure of your footing. A slip and fall can cause serious personal injury. If you feel you are losing your footing, release the blade control handle immediately and the blade will stop rotating within three seconds.\n19. Mow only in daylight or good artificial light. Walk, never run.\n20. Stop the blade when crossing gravel drives, walks or roads.\n21. If the equipment should start to vibrate abnormally, stop the engine and check immediately for the cause. Vibration is generally a warning of trouble.\n22. Shut the engine off and wait until the blade comes to a complete stop before removing the grass catcher or unclogging the chute. The cutting blade continues to rotate for a few seconds after the blade control is released. Never place any part of the body in the blade area until you are sure the blade has stopped rotating.\n23. Never operate mower without proper trail shield, discharge cover, grass catcher, blade control or other safety protective devices in place and working. Never operate mower with damaged safety devices. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.\n24. Muffler and engine become hot and can cause a burn. Do not touch.\n25. Never attempt to make a wheel or cutting height adjustment while the engine is running.\n26. Only use parts and accessories made for this machine by the manufacturer. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.",
            "27. When starting engine, pull cord slowly until resistance is felt, then pull rapidly. Rapid retraction of starter cord (kickback) will pull hand and arm toward engine faster than you can let go. Broken bones, fractures, bruises or sprains could result.\n28. If situations occur which are not covered in this manual, use care and good judgment. Contact Customer Support for assistance and the name of your nearest servicing dealer.",
            "### Children\n\nTragic accidents can occur if the operator is not alert to the presence of children. Children are often attracted to the mower and the mowing activity. They do not understand the dangers. Never assume that children will remain where you last saw them.\n\n1. Keep children out of the mowing area and under watchful care of a responsible adult other than the operator.\n2. Be alert and turn mower off if a child enters the area.\n3. Before and while moving backwards, look behind and down for small children.\n4. Use extreme care when approaching blind corners, doorways, shrubs, trees, or other objects that may block your vision of a child who may run into the mower.\n5. Keep children away from hot or running engines. They can suffer burns from a hot muffler.\n6. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and be trained and supervised by an adult.\n\n### Service\n\nSafe Handling of Gasoline\n\nTo avoid personal injury or property damage, use extreme care in handling gasoline. Gasoline is extremely flammable and the vapors are explosive. Serious personal injury can occur when gasoline is spilled on yourself or your clothes, which can ignite. Wash your skin and change clothes immediately.\n\n1. Use only an approved gasoline container.\n2. Never fill containers inside a vehicle or on a truck or trailer bed with a plastic liner. Always place containers on the ground away from your vehicle before filling.\n3. Remove gas-powered equipment from the truck or trailer and refuel it on the ground. If this is not possible, then refuel such equipment on a trailer with a portable container, rather than from a gasoline dispenser nozzle.\n4. Keep the nozzle in contact with the rim of the fuel tank or container opening at all times until fueling is complete. Do not use a nozzle lock-open device.\n5. Extinguish all cigarettes, cigars, pipes and other sources of ignition.\n6. Never fuel machine indoors because flammable vapors will accumulate in the area.\n7. Never remove gas cap or add fuel while the engine is hot or running. Allow engine to cool at least two minutes before refueling.\n8. Never overfill fuel tank. Fill tank to no more than \u00bd inch below bottom of filler neck to provide space for fuel expansion.\n9. Replace gasoline cap and tighten securely.\n10. If gasoline is spilled, wipe it off the engine and equipment. Move machine to another area. Wait 5 minutes before starting engine.\n11. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light (e.g. furnace, water heater, space heater, clothes dryer, etc.).\n12. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n13. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light such as a water heater, furnace, clothes dryer etc.\n14. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n\n---\n\n## General Service\n\n1. Never run an engine indoors or in a poorly ventilated area. Engine exhaust contains carbon monoxide, an odorless and deadly gas.\n2. Before cleaning, repairing, or inspecting, make certain the blade and all moving parts have stopped. Disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine to prevent unintended starting.\n3. Check the blade and engine mounting bolts at frequent intervals for proper tightness. Also, visually inspect blade for damage (e.g., bent, cracked, worn). Replace blade with the original equipment manufacturer\u2019s (O.E.M.) blade only, listed in this manual. \u201cUse of parts which do not meet the original equipment specifications may lead to improper performance and compromise safety!\u201d\n4. Mower blades are sharp and can cut. Wrap the blade or wear gloves, and use extra caution when servicing them.\n5. Keep all nuts, bolts, and screws tight to be sure the equipment is in safe working condition.\n6. Never tamper with safety devices. Check their proper operation regularly.\n7. After striking a foreign object, stop the engine, disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine. Thoroughly inspect the mower for any damage. Repair the damage before starting and operating the mower.\n8. Never attempt to make adjustments or repairs to the mower while the engine is running.\n9. Grass catcher components are subject to wear, damage and deterioration, which could expose moving parts or allow objects to be thrown. Frequently check components and replace with the manufacturer\u2019s recommended parts when necessary.\n10. Mower blades are sharp and can cut.

            "### DANGER\n\nThis machine was built to be operated according to the safe operation practices in this manual. As with any type of power equipment, carelessness or error on the part of the operator can result in serious injury. This machine is capable of amputating fingers, hands, toes and feet and throwing objects. Failure to observe the following safety instructions could result in serious injury or death.\n\n### General Operation",
            "1. Read this operator's manual carefully in its entirety before attempting to assemble this machine. Read, understand, and follow all instructions on the machine and in the manual(s) before operation. Keep this manual in a safe place for future and regular reference and for ordering replacement parts.\n2. Be completely familiar with the controls and the proper use of this machine before operating it.\n3. This machine is a precision piece of power equipment, not a plaything. Therefore, exercise extreme caution at all times. This machine has been designed to perform one job: to mow grass. Do not use it for any other purpose.\n4. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and should be trained and supervised by an adult.\n5. Only responsible individuals who are familiar with these rules of safe operation should be allowed to use this machine.\n6. Thoroughly inspect the area where the equipment is to be used. Remove all stones, sticks, wire, bones, toys and other foreign objects, which could be tripped over or picked up and thrown by the blade. Thrown objects can cause serious personal injury.\n7. Plan your mowing pattern to avoid discharge of material toward roads, sidewalks, bystanders and the like. Also, avoid discharging material against a wall or obstruction, which may cause discharged material to ricochet back toward the operator.\n8. To help avoid blade contact or a thrown object injury, stay in operator zone behind handles and keep children, bystanders, helpers and pets at least 75 feet from mower while it is in operation. Stop machine if anyone enters area.\n9. Always wear safety glasses or safety goggles during operation and while performing an adjustment or repair to protect your eyes. Thrown objects which ricochet can cause serious injury to the eyes.\n10. Wear sturdy, rough-soled work shoes and close-fitting slacks and shirts. Shirts and pants that cover the arms and legs and steel-toed shoes are recommended. Never operate this machine in bare feet, sandals, slippery or lightweight (e.g., canvas) shoes.\n11. Do not put hands or feet near rotating parts or under the cutting deck. Contact with blade can amputate fingers, hands, toes and feet.\n12. A missing or damaged discharge cover can cause blade contact or thrown object injuries.\n13. Many injuries occur as a result of the mower being pulled over the foot during a fall caused by slipping or tripping. Do not hold onto the mower if you are falling; release the handle immediately.\n14. Never pull the mower back toward you while you are walking. If you must back the mower away from a wall or obstruction first look down and behind to avoid tripping and then follow these steps:\n    - Step back from mower to fully extend your arms.\n    - Be sure you are well balanced with sure footing.\n    - Pull the mower back slowly, no more than halfway toward you.\n    - Repeat these steps as needed.\n15. Do not operate the mower while under the influence of alcohol or drugs.\n16. Do not engage the self-propelled mechanism on machines so equipped while starting engine.\n17. The blade control is a safety device. Never attempt to bypass its operation. Doing so makes the safety device inoperative and may result in personal injury through contact with the rotating blade. The blade control must operate easily in both directions and automatically return to the disengaged position when released.\n18. Never operate the mower in wet grass. Always be sure of your footing. A slip and fall can cause serious personal injury. If you feel you are losing your footing, release the blade control handle immediately and the blade will stop rotating within three seconds.\n19. Mow only in daylight or good artificial light. Walk, never run.\n20. Stop the blade when crossing gravel drives, walks or roads.\n21. If the equipment should start to vibrate abnormally, stop the engine and check immediately for the cause. Vibration is generally a warning of trouble.\n22. Shut the engine off and wait until the blade comes to a complete stop before removing the grass catcher or unclogging the chute. The cutting blade continues to rotate for a few seconds after the blade control is released. Never place any part of the body in the blade area until you are sure the blade has stopped rotating.\n23. Never operate mower without proper trail shield, discharge cover, grass catcher, blade control or other safety protective devices in place and working. Never operate mower with damaged safety devices. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.\n24. Muffler and engine become hot and can cause a burn. Do not touch.\n25. Never attempt to make a wheel or cutting height adjustment while the engine is running.\n26. Only use parts and accessories made for this machine by the manufacturer. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.",
            "27. When starting engine, pull cord slowly until resistance is felt, then pull rapidly. Rapid retraction of starter cord (kickback) will pull hand and arm toward engine faster than you can let go. Broken bones, fractures, bruises or sprains could result.\n28. If situations occur which are not covered in this manual, use care and good judgment. Contact Customer Support for assistance and the name of your nearest servicing dealer.",
            "### Children\n\nTragic accidents can occur if the operator is not alert to the presence of children. Children are often attracted to the mower and the mowing activity. They do not understand the dangers. Never assume that children will remain where you last saw them.\n\n1. Keep children out of the mowing area and under watchful care of a responsible adult other than the operator.\n2. Be alert and turn mower off if a child enters the area.\n3. Before and while moving backwards, look behind and down for small children.\n4. Use extreme care when approaching blind corners, doorways, shrubs, trees, or other objects that may block your vision of a child who may run into the mower.\n5. Keep children away from hot or running engines. They can suffer burns from a hot muffler.\n6. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and be trained and supervised by an adult.\n\n### Service\n\nSafe Handling of Gasoline\n\nTo avoid personal injury or property damage, use extreme care in handling gasoline. Gasoline is extremely flammable and the vapors are explosive. Serious personal injury can occur when gasoline is spilled on yourself or your clothes, which can ignite. Wash your skin and change clothes immediately.\n\n1. Use only an approved gasoline container.\n2. Never fill containers inside a vehicle or on a truck or trailer bed with a plastic liner. Always place containers on the ground away from your vehicle before filling.\n3. Remove gas-powered equipment from the truck or trailer and refuel it on the ground. If this is not possible, then refuel such equipment on a trailer with a portable container, rather than from a gasoline dispenser nozzle.\n4. Keep the nozzle in contact with the rim of the fuel tank or container opening at all times until fueling is complete. Do not use a nozzle lock-open device.\n5. Extinguish all cigarettes, cigars, pipes and other sources of ignition.\n6. Never fuel machine indoors because flammable vapors will accumulate in the area.\n7. Never remove gas cap or add fuel while the engine is hot or running. Allow engine to cool at least two minutes before refueling.\n8. Never overfill fuel tank. Fill tank to no more than \u00bd inch below bottom of filler neck to provide space for fuel expansion.\n9. Replace gasoline cap and tighten securely.\n10. If gasoline is spilled, wipe it off the engine and equipment. Move machine to another area. Wait 5 minutes before starting engine.\n11. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light (e.g. furnace, water heater, space heater, clothes dryer, etc.).\n12. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n13. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light such as a water heater, furnace, clothes dryer etc.\n14. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n\n---\n\n## General Service\n\n1. Never run an engine indoors or in a poorly ventilated area. Engine exhaust contains carbon monoxide, an odorless and deadly gas.\n2. Before cleaning, repairing, or inspecting, make certain the blade and all moving parts have stopped. Disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine to prevent unintended starting.\n3. Check the blade and engine mounting bolts at frequent intervals for proper tightness. Also, visually inspect blade for damage (e.g., bent, cracked, worn). Replace blade with the original equipment manufacturer\u2019s (O.E.M.) blade only, listed in this manual. \u201cUse of parts which do not meet the original equipment specifications may lead to improper performance and compromise safety!\u201d\n4. Mower blades are sharp and can cut. Wrap the blade or wear gloves, and use extra caution when servicing them.\n5. Keep all nuts, bolts, and screws tight to be sure the equipment is in safe working condition.\n6. Never tamper with safety devices. Check their proper operation regularly.\n7. After striking a foreign object, stop the engine, disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine. Thoroughly inspect the mower for any damage. Repair the damage before starting and operating the mower.\n8. Never attempt to make adjustments or repairs to the mower while the engine is running.\n9. Grass catcher components are subject to wear, damage and deterioration, which could expose moving parts or allow objects to be thrown. Frequently check components and replace with the manufacturer\u2019s recommended parts when necessary.\n10. Mower blades are sharp and can cut.

            "### DANGER\n\nThis machine was built to be operated according to the safe operation practices in this manual. As with any type of power equipment, carelessness or error on the part of the operator can result in serious injury. This machine is capable of amputating fingers, hands, toes and feet and throwing objects. Failure to observe the following safety instructions could result in serious injury or death.\n\n### General Operation",
            "1. Read this operator's manual carefully in its entirety before attempting to assemble this machine. Read, understand, and follow all instructions on the machine and in the manual(s) before operation. Keep this manual in a safe place for future and regular reference and for ordering replacement parts.\n2. Be completely familiar with the controls and the proper use of this machine before operating it.\n3. This machine is a precision piece of power equipment, not a plaything. Therefore, exercise extreme caution at all times. This machine has been designed to perform one job: to mow grass. Do not use it for any other purpose.\n4. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and should be trained and supervised by an adult.\n5. Only responsible individuals who are familiar with these rules of safe operation should be allowed to use this machine.\n6. Thoroughly inspect the area where the equipment is to be used. Remove all stones, sticks, wire, bones, toys and other foreign objects, which could be tripped over or picked up and thrown by the blade. Thrown objects can cause serious personal injury.\n7. Plan your mowing pattern to avoid discharge of material toward roads, sidewalks, bystanders and the like. Also, avoid discharging material against a wall or obstruction, which may cause discharged material to ricochet back toward the operator.\n8. To help avoid blade contact or a thrown object injury, stay in operator zone behind handles and keep children, bystanders, helpers and pets at least 75 feet from mower while it is in operation. Stop machine if anyone enters area.\n9. Always wear safety glasses or safety goggles during operation and while performing an adjustment or repair to protect your eyes. Thrown objects which ricochet can cause serious injury to the eyes.\n10. Wear sturdy, rough-soled work shoes and close-fitting slacks and shirts. Shirts and pants that cover the arms and legs and steel-toed shoes are recommended. Never operate this machine in bare feet, sandals, slippery or lightweight (e.g., canvas) shoes.\n11. Do not put hands or feet near rotating parts or under the cutting deck. Contact with blade can amputate fingers, hands, toes and feet.\n12. A missing or damaged discharge cover can cause blade contact or thrown object injuries.\n13. Many injuries occur as a result of the mower being pulled over the foot during a fall caused by slipping or tripping. Do not hold onto the mower if you are falling; release the handle immediately.\n14. Never pull the mower back toward you while you are walking. If you must back the mower away from a wall or obstruction first look down and behind to avoid tripping and then follow these steps:\n    - Step back from mower to fully extend your arms.\n    - Be sure you are well balanced with sure footing.\n    - Pull the mower back slowly, no more than halfway toward you.\n    - Repeat these steps as needed.\n15. Do not operate the mower while under the influence of alcohol or drugs.\n16. Do not engage the self-propelled mechanism on machines so equipped while starting engine.\n17. The blade control is a safety device. Never attempt to bypass its operation. Doing so makes the safety device inoperative and may result in personal injury through contact with the rotating blade. The blade control must operate easily in both directions and automatically return to the disengaged position when released.\n18. Never operate the mower in wet grass. Always be sure of your footing. A slip and fall can cause serious personal injury. If you feel you are losing your footing, release the blade control handle immediately and the blade will stop rotating within three seconds.\n19. Mow only in daylight or good artificial light. Walk, never run.\n20. Stop the blade when crossing gravel drives, walks or roads.\n21. If the equipment should start to vibrate abnormally, stop the engine and check immediately for the cause. Vibration is generally a warning of trouble.\n22. Shut the engine off and wait until the blade comes to a complete stop before removing the grass catcher or unclogging the chute. The cutting blade continues to rotate for a few seconds after the blade control is released. Never place any part of the body in the blade area until you are sure the blade has stopped rotating.\n23. Never operate mower without proper trail shield, discharge cover, grass catcher, blade control or other safety protective devices in place and working. Never operate mower with damaged safety devices. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.\n24. Muffler and engine become hot and can cause a burn. Do not touch.\n25. Never attempt to make a wheel or cutting height adjustment while the engine is running.\n26. Only use parts and accessories made for this machine by the manufacturer. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.",
            "27. When starting engine, pull cord slowly until resistance is felt, then pull rapidly. Rapid retraction of starter cord (kickback) will pull hand and arm toward engine faster than you can let go. Broken bones, fractures, bruises or sprains could result.\n28. If situations occur which are not covered in this manual, use care and good judgment. Contact Customer Support for assistance and the name of your nearest servicing dealer.",
            "### Children\n\nTragic accidents can occur if the operator is not alert to the presence of children. Children are often attracted to the mower and the mowing activity. They do not understand the dangers. Never assume that children will remain where you last saw them.\n\n1. Keep children out of the mowing area and under watchful care of a responsible adult other than the operator.\n2. Be alert and turn mower off if a child enters the area.\n3. Before and while moving backwards, look behind and down for small children.\n4. Use extreme care when approaching blind corners, doorways, shrubs, trees, or other objects that may block your vision of a child who may run into the mower.\n5. Keep children away from hot or running engines. They can suffer burns from a hot muffler.\n6. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and be trained and supervised by an adult.\n\n### Service\n\nSafe Handling of Gasoline\n\nTo avoid personal injury or property damage, use extreme care in handling gasoline. Gasoline is extremely flammable and the vapors are explosive. Serious personal injury can occur when gasoline is spilled on yourself or your clothes, which can ignite. Wash your skin and change clothes immediately.\n\n1. Use only an approved gasoline container.\n2. Never fill containers inside a vehicle or on a truck or trailer bed with a plastic liner. Always place containers on the ground away from your vehicle before filling.\n3. Remove gas-powered equipment from the truck or trailer and refuel it on the ground. If this is not possible, then refuel such equipment on a trailer with a portable container, rather than from a gasoline dispenser nozzle.\n4. Keep the nozzle in contact with the rim of the fuel tank or container opening at all times until fueling is complete. Do not use a nozzle lock-open device.\n5. Extinguish all cigarettes, cigars, pipes and other sources of ignition.\n6. Never fuel machine indoors because flammable vapors will accumulate in the area.\n7. Never remove gas cap or add fuel while the engine is hot or running. Allow engine to cool at least two minutes before refueling.\n8. Never overfill fuel tank. Fill tank to no more than \u00bd inch below bottom of filler neck to provide space for fuel expansion.\n9. Replace gasoline cap and tighten securely.\n10. If gasoline is spilled, wipe it off the engine and equipment. Move machine to another area. Wait 5 minutes before starting engine.\n11. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light (e.g. furnace, water heater, space heater, clothes dryer, etc.).\n12. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n13. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light such as a water heater, furnace, clothes dryer etc.\n14. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n\n---\n\n## General Service\n\n1. Never run an engine indoors or in a poorly ventilated area. Engine exhaust contains carbon monoxide, an odorless and deadly gas.\n2. Before cleaning, repairing, or inspecting, make certain the blade and all moving parts have stopped. Disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine to prevent unintended starting.\n3. Check the blade and engine mounting bolts at frequent intervals for proper tightness. Also, visually inspect blade for damage (e.g., bent, cracked, worn). Replace blade with the original equipment manufacturer\u2019s (O.E.M.) blade only, listed in this manual. \u201cUse of parts which do not meet the original equipment specifications may lead to improper performance and compromise safety!\u201d\n4. Mower blades are sharp and can cut. Wrap the blade or wear gloves, and use extra caution when servicing them.\n5. Keep all nuts, bolts, and screws tight to be sure the equipment is in safe working condition.\n6. Never tamper with safety devices. Check their proper operation regularly.\n7. After striking a foreign object, stop the engine, disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine. Thoroughly inspect the mower for any damage. Repair the damage before starting and operating the mower.\n8. Never attempt to make adjustments or repairs to the mower while the engine is running.\n9. Grass catcher components are subject to wear, damage and deterioration, which could expose moving parts or allow objects to be thrown. Frequently check components and replace with the manufacturer\u2019s recommended parts when necessary.\n10. Mower blades are sharp and can cut.

            "### DANGER\n\nThis machine was built to be operated according to the safe operation practices in this manual. As with any type of power equipment, carelessness or error on the part of the operator can result in serious injury. This machine is capable of amputating fingers, hands, toes and feet and throwing objects. Failure to observe the following safety instructions could result in serious injury or death.\n\n### General Operation",
            "1. Read this operator's manual carefully in its entirety before attempting to assemble this machine. Read, understand, and follow all instructions on the machine and in the manual(s) before operation. Keep this manual in a safe place for future and regular reference and for ordering replacement parts.\n2. Be completely familiar with the controls and the proper use of this machine before operating it.\n3. This machine is a precision piece of power equipment, not a plaything. Therefore, exercise extreme caution at all times. This machine has been designed to perform one job: to mow grass. Do not use it for any other purpose.\n4. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and should be trained and supervised by an adult.\n5. Only responsible individuals who are familiar with these rules of safe operation should be allowed to use this machine.\n6. Thoroughly inspect the area where the equipment is to be used. Remove all stones, sticks, wire, bones, toys and other foreign objects, which could be tripped over or picked up and thrown by the blade. Thrown objects can cause serious personal injury.\n7. Plan your mowing pattern to avoid discharge of material toward roads, sidewalks, bystanders and the like. Also, avoid discharging material against a wall or obstruction, which may cause discharged material to ricochet back toward the operator.\n8. To help avoid blade contact or a thrown object injury, stay in operator zone behind handles and keep children, bystanders, helpers and pets at least 75 feet from mower while it is in operation. Stop machine if anyone enters area.\n9. Always wear safety glasses or safety goggles during operation and while performing an adjustment or repair to protect your eyes. Thrown objects which ricochet can cause serious injury to the eyes.\n10. Wear sturdy, rough-soled work shoes and close-fitting slacks and shirts. Shirts and pants that cover the arms and legs and steel-toed shoes are recommended. Never operate this machine in bare feet, sandals, slippery or lightweight (e.g., canvas) shoes.\n11. Do not put hands or feet near rotating parts or under the cutting deck. Contact with blade can amputate fingers, hands, toes and feet.\n12. A missing or damaged discharge cover can cause blade contact or thrown object injuries.\n13. Many injuries occur as a result of the mower being pulled over the foot during a fall caused by slipping or tripping. Do not hold onto the mower if you are falling; release the handle immediately.\n14. Never pull the mower back toward you while you are walking. If you must back the mower away from a wall or obstruction first look down and behind to avoid tripping and then follow these steps:\n    - Step back from mower to fully extend your arms.\n    - Be sure you are well balanced with sure footing.\n    - Pull the mower back slowly, no more than halfway toward you.\n    - Repeat these steps as needed.\n15. Do not operate the mower while under the influence of alcohol or drugs.\n16. Do not engage the self-propelled mechanism on machines so equipped while starting engine.\n17. The blade control is a safety device. Never attempt to bypass its operation. Doing so makes the safety device inoperative and may result in personal injury through contact with the rotating blade. The blade control must operate easily in both directions and automatically return to the disengaged position when released.\n18. Never operate the mower in wet grass. Always be sure of your footing. A slip and fall can cause serious personal injury. If you feel you are losing your footing, release the blade control handle immediately and the blade will stop rotating within three seconds.\n19. Mow only in daylight or good artificial light. Walk, never run.\n20. Stop the blade when crossing gravel drives, walks or roads.\n21. If the equipment should start to vibrate abnormally, stop the engine and check immediately for the cause. Vibration is generally a warning of trouble.\n22. Shut the engine off and wait until the blade comes to a complete stop before removing the grass catcher or unclogging the chute. The cutting blade continues to rotate for a few seconds after the blade control is released. Never place any part of the body in the blade area until you are sure the blade has stopped rotating.\n23. Never operate mower without proper trail shield, discharge cover, grass catcher, blade control or other safety protective devices in place and working. Never operate mower with damaged safety devices. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.\n24. Muffler and engine become hot and can cause a burn. Do not touch.\n25. Never attempt to make a wheel or cutting height adjustment while the engine is running.\n26. Only use parts and accessories made for this machine by the manufacturer. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.",
            "27. When starting engine, pull cord slowly until resistance is felt, then pull rapidly. Rapid retraction of starter cord (kickback) will pull hand and arm toward engine faster than you can let go. Broken bones, fractures, bruises or sprains could result.\n28. If situations occur which are not covered in this manual, use care and good judgment. Contact Customer Support for assistance and the name of your nearest servicing dealer.",
            "### Children\n\nTragic accidents can occur if the operator is not alert to the presence of children. Children are often attracted to the mower and the mowing activity. They do not understand the dangers. Never assume that children will remain where you last saw them.\n\n1. Keep children out of the mowing area and under watchful care of a responsible adult other than the operator.\n2. Be alert and turn mower off if a child enters the area.\n3. Before and while moving backwards, look behind and down for small children.\n4. Use extreme care when approaching blind corners, doorways, shrubs, trees, or other objects that may block your vision of a child who may run into the mower.\n5. Keep children away from hot or running engines. They can suffer burns from a hot muffler.\n6. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and be trained and supervised by an adult.\n\n### Service\n\nSafe Handling of Gasoline\n\nTo avoid personal injury or property damage, use extreme care in handling gasoline. Gasoline is extremely flammable and the vapors are explosive. Serious personal injury can occur when gasoline is spilled on yourself or your clothes, which can ignite. Wash your skin and change clothes immediately.\n\n1. Use only an approved gasoline container.\n2. Never fill containers inside a vehicle or on a truck or trailer bed with a plastic liner. Always place containers on the ground away from your vehicle before filling.\n3. Remove gas-powered equipment from the truck or trailer and refuel it on the ground. If this is not possible, then refuel such equipment on a trailer with a portable container, rather than from a gasoline dispenser nozzle.\n4. Keep the nozzle in contact with the rim of the fuel tank or container opening at all times until fueling is complete. Do not use a nozzle lock-open device.\n5. Extinguish all cigarettes, cigars, pipes and other sources of ignition.\n6. Never fuel machine indoors because flammable vapors will accumulate in the area.\n7. Never remove gas cap or add fuel while the engine is hot or running. Allow engine to cool at least two minutes before refueling.\n8. Never overfill fuel tank. Fill tank to no more than \u00bd inch below bottom of filler neck to provide space for fuel expansion.\n9. Replace gasoline cap and tighten securely.\n10. If gasoline is spilled, wipe it off the engine and equipment. Move machine to another area. Wait 5 minutes before starting engine.\n11. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light (e.g. furnace, water heater, space heater, clothes dryer, etc.).\n12. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n13. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light such as a water heater, furnace, clothes dryer etc.\n14. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n\n---\n\n## General Service\n\n1. Never run an engine indoors or in a poorly ventilated area. Engine exhaust contains carbon monoxide, an odorless and deadly gas.\n2. Before cleaning, repairing, or inspecting, make certain the blade and all moving parts have stopped. Disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine to prevent unintended starting.\n3. Check the blade and engine mounting bolts at frequent intervals for proper tightness. Also, visually inspect blade for damage (e.g., bent, cracked, worn). Replace blade with the original equipment manufacturer\u2019s (O.E.M.) blade only, listed in this manual. \u201cUse of parts which do not meet the original equipment specifications may lead to improper performance and compromise safety!\u201d\n4. Mower blades are sharp and can cut. Wrap the blade or wear gloves, and use extra caution when servicing them.\n5. Keep all nuts, bolts, and screws tight to be sure the equipment is in safe working condition.\n6. Never tamper with safety devices. Check their proper operation regularly.\n7. After striking a foreign object, stop the engine, disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine. Thoroughly inspect the mower for any damage. Repair the damage before starting and operating the mower.\n8. Never attempt to make adjustments or repairs to the mower while the engine is running.\n9. Grass catcher components are subject to wear, damage and deterioration, which could expose moving parts or allow objects to be thrown. Frequently check components and replace with the manufacturer\u2019s recommended parts when necessary.\n10. Mower blades are sharp and can cut.

            "### DANGER\n\nThis machine was built to be operated according to the safe operation practices in this manual. As with any type of power equipment, carelessness or error on the part of the operator can result in serious injury. This machine is capable of amputating fingers, hands, toes and feet and throwing objects. Failure to observe the following safety instructions could result in serious injury or death.\n\n### General Operation",
            "1. Read this operator's manual carefully in its entirety before attempting to assemble this machine. Read, understand, and follow all instructions on the machine and in the manual(s) before operation. Keep this manual in a safe place for future and regular reference and for ordering replacement parts.\n2. Be completely familiar with the controls and the proper use of this machine before operating it.\n3. This machine is a precision piece of power equipment, not a plaything. Therefore, exercise extreme caution at all times. This machine has been designed to perform one job: to mow grass. Do not use it for any other purpose.\n4. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and should be trained and supervised by an adult.\n5. Only responsible individuals who are familiar with these rules of safe operation should be allowed to use this machine.\n6. Thoroughly inspect the area where the equipment is to be used. Remove all stones, sticks, wire, bones, toys and other foreign objects, which could be tripped over or picked up and thrown by the blade. Thrown objects can cause serious personal injury.\n7. Plan your mowing pattern to avoid discharge of material toward roads, sidewalks, bystanders and the like. Also, avoid discharging material against a wall or obstruction, which may cause discharged material to ricochet back toward the operator.\n8. To help avoid blade contact or a thrown object injury, stay in operator zone behind handles and keep children, bystanders, helpers and pets at least 75 feet from mower while it is in operation. Stop machine if anyone enters area.\n9. Always wear safety glasses or safety goggles during operation and while performing an adjustment or repair to protect your eyes. Thrown objects which ricochet can cause serious injury to the eyes.\n10. Wear sturdy, rough-soled work shoes and close-fitting slacks and shirts. Shirts and pants that cover the arms and legs and steel-toed shoes are recommended. Never operate this machine in bare feet, sandals, slippery or lightweight (e.g., canvas) shoes.\n11. Do not put hands or feet near rotating parts or under the cutting deck. Contact with blade can amputate fingers, hands, toes and feet.\n12. A missing or damaged discharge cover can cause blade contact or thrown object injuries.\n13. Many injuries occur as a result of the mower being pulled over the foot during a fall caused by slipping or tripping. Do not hold onto the mower if you are falling; release the handle immediately.\n14. Never pull the mower back toward you while you are walking. If you must back the mower away from a wall or obstruction first look down and behind to avoid tripping and then follow these steps:\n    - Step back from mower to fully extend your arms.\n    - Be sure you are well balanced with sure footing.\n    - Pull the mower back slowly, no more than halfway toward you.\n    - Repeat these steps as needed.\n15. Do not operate the mower while under the influence of alcohol or drugs.\n16. Do not engage the self-propelled mechanism on machines so equipped while starting engine.\n17. The blade control is a safety device. Never attempt to bypass its operation. Doing so makes the safety device inoperative and may result in personal injury through contact with the rotating blade. The blade control must operate easily in both directions and automatically return to the disengaged position when released.\n18. Never operate the mower in wet grass. Always be sure of your footing. A slip and fall can cause serious personal injury. If you feel you are losing your footing, release the blade control handle immediately and the blade will stop rotating within three seconds.\n19. Mow only in daylight or good artificial light. Walk, never run.\n20. Stop the blade when crossing gravel drives, walks or roads.\n21. If the equipment should start to vibrate abnormally, stop the engine and check immediately for the cause. Vibration is generally a warning of trouble.\n22. Shut the engine off and wait until the blade comes to a complete stop before removing the grass catcher or unclogging the chute. The cutting blade continues to rotate for a few seconds after the blade control is released. Never place any part of the body in the blade area until you are sure the blade has stopped rotating.\n23. Never operate mower without proper trail shield, discharge cover, grass catcher, blade control or other safety protective devices in place and working. Never operate mower with damaged safety devices. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.\n24. Muffler and engine become hot and can cause a burn. Do not touch.\n25. Never attempt to make a wheel or cutting height adjustment while the engine is running.\n26. Only use parts and accessories made for this machine by the manufacturer. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.",
            "27. When starting engine, pull cord slowly until resistance is felt, then pull rapidly. Rapid retraction of starter cord (kickback) will pull hand and arm toward engine faster than you can let go. Broken bones, fractures, bruises or sprains could result.\n28. If situations occur which are not covered in this manual, use care and good judgment. Contact Customer Support for assistance and the name of your nearest servicing dealer.",
            "### Children\n\nTragic accidents can occur if the operator is not alert to the presence of children. Children are often attracted to the mower and the mowing activity. They do not understand the dangers. Never assume that children will remain where you last saw them.\n\n1. Keep children out of the mowing area and under watchful care of a responsible adult other than the operator.\n2. Be alert and turn mower off if a child enters the area.\n3. Before and while moving backwards, look behind and down for small children.\n4. Use extreme care when approaching blind corners, doorways, shrubs, trees, or other objects that may block your vision of a child who may run into the mower.\n5. Keep children away from hot or running engines. They can suffer burns from a hot muffler.\n6. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and be trained and supervised by an adult.\n\n### Service\n\nSafe Handling of Gasoline\n\nTo avoid personal injury or property damage, use extreme care in handling gasoline. Gasoline is extremely flammable and the vapors are explosive. Serious personal injury can occur when gasoline is spilled on yourself or your clothes, which can ignite. Wash your skin and change clothes immediately.\n\n1. Use only an approved gasoline container.\n2. Never fill containers inside a vehicle or on a truck or trailer bed with a plastic liner. Always place containers on the ground away from your vehicle before filling.\n3. Remove gas-powered equipment from the truck or trailer and refuel it on the ground. If this is not possible, then refuel such equipment on a trailer with a portable container, rather than from a gasoline dispenser nozzle.\n4. Keep the nozzle in contact with the rim of the fuel tank or container opening at all times until fueling is complete. Do not use a nozzle lock-open device.\n5. Extinguish all cigarettes, cigars, pipes and other sources of ignition.\n6. Never fuel machine indoors because flammable vapors will accumulate in the area.\n7. Never remove gas cap or add fuel while the engine is hot or running. Allow engine to cool at least two minutes before refueling.\n8. Never overfill fuel tank. Fill tank to no more than \u00bd inch below bottom of filler neck to provide space for fuel expansion.\n9. Replace gasoline cap and tighten securely.\n10. If gasoline is spilled, wipe it off the engine and equipment. Move machine to another area. Wait 5 minutes before starting engine.\n11. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light (e.g. furnace, water heater, space heater, clothes dryer, etc.).\n12. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n13. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light such as a water heater, furnace, clothes dryer etc.\n14. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n\n---\n\n## General Service\n\n1. Never run an engine indoors or in a poorly ventilated area. Engine exhaust contains carbon monoxide, an odorless and deadly gas.\n2. Before cleaning, repairing, or inspecting, make certain the blade and all moving parts have stopped. Disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine to prevent unintended starting.\n3. Check the blade and engine mounting bolts at frequent intervals for proper tightness. Also, visually inspect blade for damage (e.g., bent, cracked, worn). Replace blade with the original equipment manufacturer\u2019s (O.E.M.) blade only, listed in this manual. \u201cUse of parts which do not meet the original equipment specifications may lead to improper performance and compromise safety!\u201d\n4. Mower blades are sharp and can cut. Wrap the blade or wear gloves, and use extra caution when servicing them.\n5. Keep all nuts, bolts, and screws tight to be sure the equipment is in safe working condition.\n6. Never tamper with safety devices. Check their proper operation regularly.\n7. After striking a foreign object, stop the engine, disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine. Thoroughly inspect the mower for any damage. Repair the damage before starting and operating the mower.\n8. Never attempt to make adjustments or repairs to the mower while the engine is running.\n9. Grass catcher components are subject to wear, damage and deterioration, which could expose moving parts or allow objects to be thrown. Frequently check components and replace with the manufacturer\u2019s recommended parts when necessary.\n10. Mower blades are sharp and can cut.

            "### DANGER\n\nThis machine was built to be operated according to the safe operation practices in this manual. As with any type of power equipment, carelessness or error on the part of the operator can result in serious injury. This machine is capable of amputating fingers, hands, toes and feet and throwing objects. Failure to observe the following safety instructions could result in serious injury or death.\n\n### General Operation",
            "1. Read this operator's manual carefully in its entirety before attempting to assemble this machine. Read, understand, and follow all instructions on the machine and in the manual(s) before operation. Keep this manual in a safe place for future and regular reference and for ordering replacement parts.\n2. Be completely familiar with the controls and the proper use of this machine before operating it.\n3. This machine is a precision piece of power equipment, not a plaything. Therefore, exercise extreme caution at all times. This machine has been designed to perform one job: to mow grass. Do not use it for any other purpose.\n4. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and should be trained and supervised by an adult.\n5. Only responsible individuals who are familiar with these rules of safe operation should be allowed to use this machine.\n6. Thoroughly inspect the area where the equipment is to be used. Remove all stones, sticks, wire, bones, toys and other foreign objects, which could be tripped over or picked up and thrown by the blade. Thrown objects can cause serious personal injury.\n7. Plan your mowing pattern to avoid discharge of material toward roads, sidewalks, bystanders and the like. Also, avoid discharging material against a wall or obstruction, which may cause discharged material to ricochet back toward the operator.\n8. To help avoid blade contact or a thrown object injury, stay in operator zone behind handles and keep children, bystanders, helpers and pets at least 75 feet from mower while it is in operation. Stop machine if anyone enters area.\n9. Always wear safety glasses or safety goggles during operation and while performing an adjustment or repair to protect your eyes. Thrown objects which ricochet can cause serious injury to the eyes.\n10. Wear sturdy, rough-soled work shoes and close-fitting slacks and shirts. Shirts and pants that cover the arms and legs and steel-toed shoes are recommended. Never operate this machine in bare feet, sandals, slippery or lightweight (e.g., canvas) shoes.\n11. Do not put hands or feet near rotating parts or under the cutting deck. Contact with blade can amputate fingers, hands, toes and feet.\n12. A missing or damaged discharge cover can cause blade contact or thrown object injuries.\n13. Many injuries occur as a result of the mower being pulled over the foot during a fall caused by slipping or tripping. Do not hold onto the mower if you are falling; release the handle immediately.\n14. Never pull the mower back toward you while you are walking. If you must back the mower away from a wall or obstruction first look down and behind to avoid tripping and then follow these steps:\n    - Step back from mower to fully extend your arms.\n    - Be sure you are well balanced with sure footing.\n    - Pull the mower back slowly, no more than halfway toward you.\n    - Repeat these steps as needed.\n15. Do not operate the mower while under the influence of alcohol or drugs.\n16. Do not engage the self-propelled mechanism on machines so equipped while starting engine.\n17. The blade control is a safety device. Never attempt to bypass its operation. Doing so makes the safety device inoperative and may result in personal injury through contact with the rotating blade. The blade control must operate easily in both directions and automatically return to the disengaged position when released.\n18. Never operate the mower in wet grass. Always be sure of your footing. A slip and fall can cause serious personal injury. If you feel you are losing your footing, release the blade control handle immediately and the blade will stop rotating within three seconds.\n19. Mow only in daylight or good artificial light. Walk, never run.\n20. Stop the blade when crossing gravel drives, walks or roads.\n21. If the equipment should start to vibrate abnormally, stop the engine and check immediately for the cause. Vibration is generally a warning of trouble.\n22. Shut the engine off and wait until the blade comes to a complete stop before removing the grass catcher or unclogging the chute. The cutting blade continues to rotate for a few seconds after the blade control is released. Never place any part of the body in the blade area until you are sure the blade has stopped rotating.\n23. Never operate mower without proper trail shield, discharge cover, grass catcher, blade control or other safety protective devices in place and working. Never operate mower with damaged safety devices. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.\n24. Muffler and engine become hot and can cause a burn. Do not touch.\n25. Never attempt to make a wheel or cutting height adjustment while the engine is running.\n26. Only use parts and accessories made for this machine by the manufacturer. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.",
            "27. When starting engine, pull cord slowly until resistance is felt, then pull rapidly. Rapid retraction of starter cord (kickback) will pull hand and arm toward engine faster than you can let go. Broken bones, fractures, bruises or sprains could result.\n28. If situations occur which are not covered in this manual, use care and good judgment. Contact Customer Support for assistance and the name of your nearest servicing dealer.",
            "### Children\n\nTragic accidents can occur if the operator is not alert to the presence of children. Children are often attracted to the mower and the mowing activity. They do not understand the dangers. Never assume that children will remain where you last saw them.\n\n1. Keep children out of the mowing area and under watchful care of a responsible adult other than the operator.\n2. Be alert and turn mower off if a child enters the area.\n3. Before and while moving backwards, look behind and down for small children.\n4. Use extreme care when approaching blind corners, doorways, shrubs, trees, or other objects that may block your vision of a child who may run into the mower.\n5. Keep children away from hot or running engines. They can suffer burns from a hot muffler.\n6. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and be trained and supervised by an adult.\n\n### Service\n\nSafe Handling of Gasoline\n\nTo avoid personal injury or property damage, use extreme care in handling gasoline. Gasoline is extremely flammable and the vapors are explosive. Serious personal injury can occur when gasoline is spilled on yourself or your clothes, which can ignite. Wash your skin and change clothes immediately.\n\n1. Use only an approved gasoline container.\n2. Never fill containers inside a vehicle or on a truck or trailer bed with a plastic liner. Always place containers on the ground away from your vehicle before filling.\n3. Remove gas-powered equipment from the truck or trailer and refuel it on the ground. If this is not possible, then refuel such equipment on a trailer with a portable container, rather than from a gasoline dispenser nozzle.\n4. Keep the nozzle in contact with the rim of the fuel tank or container opening at all times until fueling is complete. Do not use a nozzle lock-open device.\n5. Extinguish all cigarettes, cigars, pipes and other sources of ignition.\n6. Never fuel machine indoors because flammable vapors will accumulate in the area.\n7. Never remove gas cap or add fuel while the engine is hot or running. Allow engine to cool at least two minutes before refueling.\n8. Never overfill fuel tank. Fill tank to no more than \u00bd inch below bottom of filler neck to provide space for fuel expansion.\n9. Replace gasoline cap and tighten securely.\n10. If gasoline is spilled, wipe it off the engine and equipment. Move machine to another area. Wait 5 minutes before starting engine.\n11. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light (e.g. furnace, water heater, space heater, clothes dryer, etc.).\n12. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n13. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light such as a water heater, furnace, clothes dryer etc.\n14. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n\n---\n\n## General Service\n\n1. Never run an engine indoors or in a poorly ventilated area. Engine exhaust contains carbon monoxide, an odorless and deadly gas.\n2. Before cleaning, repairing, or inspecting, make certain the blade and all moving parts have stopped. Disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine to prevent unintended starting.\n3. Check the blade and engine mounting bolts at frequent intervals for proper tightness. Also, visually inspect blade for damage (e.g., bent, cracked, worn). Replace blade with the original equipment manufacturer\u2019s (O.E.M.) blade only, listed in this manual. \u201cUse of parts which do not meet the original equipment specifications may lead to improper performance and compromise safety!\u201d\n4. Mower blades are sharp and can cut. Wrap the blade or wear gloves, and use extra caution when servicing them.\n5. Keep all nuts, bolts, and screws tight to be sure the equipment is in safe working condition.\n6. Never tamper with safety devices. Check their proper operation regularly.\n7. After striking a foreign object, stop the engine, disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine. Thoroughly inspect the mower for any damage. Repair the damage before starting and operating the mower.\n8. Never attempt to make adjustments or repairs to the mower while the engine is running.\n9. Grass catcher components are subject to wear, damage and deterioration, which could expose moving parts or allow objects to be thrown. Frequently check components and replace with the manufacturer\u2019s recommended parts when necessary.\n10. Mower blades are sharp and can cut.

            "### DANGER\n\nThis machine was built to be operated according to the safe operation practices in this manual. As with any type of power equipment, carelessness or error on the part of the operator can result in serious injury. This machine is capable of amputating fingers, hands, toes and feet and throwing objects. Failure to observe the following safety instructions could result in serious injury or death.\n\n### General Operation",
            "1. Read this operator's manual carefully in its entirety before attempting to assemble this machine. Read, understand, and follow all instructions on the machine and in the manual(s) before operation. Keep this manual in a safe place for future and regular reference and for ordering replacement parts.\n2. Be completely familiar with the controls and the proper use of this machine before operating it.\n3. This machine is a precision piece of power equipment, not a plaything. Therefore, exercise extreme caution at all times. This machine has been designed to perform one job: to mow grass. Do not use it for any other purpose.\n4. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and should be trained and supervised by an adult.\n5. Only responsible individuals who are familiar with these rules of safe operation should be allowed to use this machine.\n6. Thoroughly inspect the area where the equipment is to be used. Remove all stones, sticks, wire, bones, toys and other foreign objects, which could be tripped over or picked up and thrown by the blade. Thrown objects can cause serious personal injury.\n7. Plan your mowing pattern to avoid discharge of material toward roads, sidewalks, bystanders and the like. Also, avoid discharging material against a wall or obstruction, which may cause discharged material to ricochet back toward the operator.\n8. To help avoid blade contact or a thrown object injury, stay in operator zone behind handles and keep children, bystanders, helpers and pets at least 75 feet from mower while it is in operation. Stop machine if anyone enters area.\n9. Always wear safety glasses or safety goggles during operation and while performing an adjustment or repair to protect your eyes. Thrown objects which ricochet can cause serious injury to the eyes.\n10. Wear sturdy, rough-soled work shoes and close-fitting slacks and shirts. Shirts and pants that cover the arms and legs and steel-toed shoes are recommended. Never operate this machine in bare feet, sandals, slippery or lightweight (e.g., canvas) shoes.\n11. Do not put hands or feet near rotating parts or under the cutting deck. Contact with blade can amputate fingers, hands, toes and feet.\n12. A missing or damaged discharge cover can cause blade contact or thrown object injuries.\n13. Many injuries occur as a result of the mower being pulled over the foot during a fall caused by slipping or tripping. Do not hold onto the mower if you are falling; release the handle immediately.\n14. Never pull the mower back toward you while you are walking. If you must back the mower away from a wall or obstruction first look down and behind to avoid tripping and then follow these steps:\n    - Step back from mower to fully extend your arms.\n    - Be sure you are well balanced with sure footing.\n    - Pull the mower back slowly, no more than halfway toward you.\n    - Repeat these steps as needed.\n15. Do not operate the mower while under the influence of alcohol or drugs.\n16. Do not engage the self-propelled mechanism on machines so equipped while starting engine.\n17. The blade control is a safety device. Never attempt to bypass its operation. Doing so makes the safety device inoperative and may result in personal injury through contact with the rotating blade. The blade control must operate easily in both directions and automatically return to the disengaged position when released.\n18. Never operate the mower in wet grass. Always be sure of your footing. A slip and fall can cause serious personal injury. If you feel you are losing your footing, release the blade control handle immediately and the blade will stop rotating within three seconds.\n19. Mow only in daylight or good artificial light. Walk, never run.\n20. Stop the blade when crossing gravel drives, walks or roads.\n21. If the equipment should start to vibrate abnormally, stop the engine and check immediately for the cause. Vibration is generally a warning of trouble.\n22. Shut the engine off and wait until the blade comes to a complete stop before removing the grass catcher or unclogging the chute. The cutting blade continues to rotate for a few seconds after the blade control is released. Never place any part of the body in the blade area until you are sure the blade has stopped rotating.\n23. Never operate mower without proper trail shield, discharge cover, grass catcher, blade control or other safety protective devices in place and working. Never operate mower with damaged safety devices. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.\n24. Muffler and engine become hot and can cause a burn. Do not touch.\n25. Never attempt to make a wheel or cutting height adjustment while the engine is running.\n26. Only use parts and accessories made for this machine by the manufacturer. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.",
            "27. When starting engine, pull cord slowly until resistance is felt, then pull rapidly. Rapid retraction of starter cord (kickback) will pull hand and arm toward engine faster than you can let go. Broken bones, fractures, bruises or sprains could result.\n28. If situations occur which are not covered in this manual, use care and good judgment. Contact Customer Support for assistance and the name of your nearest servicing dealer.",
            "### Children\n\nTragic accidents can occur if the operator is not alert to the presence of children. Children are often attracted to the mower and the mowing activity. They do not understand the dangers. Never assume that children will remain where you last saw them.\n\n1. Keep children out of the mowing area and under watchful care of a responsible adult other than the operator.\n2. Be alert and turn mower off if a child enters the area.\n3. Before and while moving backwards, look behind and down for small children.\n4. Use extreme care when approaching blind corners, doorways, shrubs, trees, or other objects that may block your vision of a child who may run into the mower.\n5. Keep children away from hot or running engines. They can suffer burns from a hot muffler.\n6. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and be trained and supervised by an adult.\n\n### Service\n\nSafe Handling of Gasoline\n\nTo avoid personal injury or property damage, use extreme care in handling gasoline. Gasoline is extremely flammable and the vapors are explosive. Serious personal injury can occur when gasoline is spilled on yourself or your clothes, which can ignite. Wash your skin and change clothes immediately.\n\n1. Use only an approved gasoline container.\n2. Never fill containers inside a vehicle or on a truck or trailer bed with a plastic liner. Always place containers on the ground away from your vehicle before filling.\n3. Remove gas-powered equipment from the truck or trailer and refuel it on the ground. If this is not possible, then refuel such equipment on a trailer with a portable container, rather than from a gasoline dispenser nozzle.\n4. Keep the nozzle in contact with the rim of the fuel tank or container opening at all times until fueling is complete. Do not use a nozzle lock-open device.\n5. Extinguish all cigarettes, cigars, pipes and other sources of ignition.\n6. Never fuel machine indoors because flammable vapors will accumulate in the area.\n7. Never remove gas cap or add fuel while the engine is hot or running. Allow engine to cool at least two minutes before refueling.\n8. Never overfill fuel tank. Fill tank to no more than \u00bd inch below bottom of filler neck to provide space for fuel expansion.\n9. Replace gasoline cap and tighten securely.\n10. If gasoline is spilled, wipe it off the engine and equipment. Move machine to another area. Wait 5 minutes before starting engine.\n11. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light (e.g. furnace, water heater, space heater, clothes dryer, etc.).\n12. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n13. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light such as a water heater, furnace, clothes dryer etc.\n14. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n\n---\n\n## General Service\n\n1. Never run an engine indoors or in a poorly ventilated area. Engine exhaust contains carbon monoxide, an odorless and deadly gas.\n2. Before cleaning, repairing, or inspecting, make certain the blade and all moving parts have stopped. Disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine to prevent unintended starting.\n3. Check the blade and engine mounting bolts at frequent intervals for proper tightness. Also, visually inspect blade for damage (e.g., bent, cracked, worn). Replace blade with the original equipment manufacturer\u2019s (O.E.M.) blade only, listed in this manual. \u201cUse of parts which do not meet the original equipment specifications may lead to improper performance and compromise safety!\u201d\n4. Mower blades are sharp and can cut. Wrap the blade or wear gloves, and use extra caution when servicing them.\n5. Keep all nuts, bolts, and screws tight to be sure the equipment is in safe working condition.\n6. Never tamper with safety devices. Check their proper operation regularly.\n7. After striking a foreign object, stop the engine, disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine. Thoroughly inspect the mower for any damage. Repair the damage before starting and operating the mower.\n8. Never attempt to make adjustments or repairs to the mower while the engine is running.\n9. Grass catcher components are subject to wear, damage and deterioration, which could expose moving parts or allow objects to be thrown. Frequently check components and replace with the manufacturer\u2019s recommended parts when necessary.\n10. Mower blades are sharp and can cut.

            "### DANGER\n\nThis machine was built to be operated according to the safe operation practices in this manual. As with any type of power equipment, carelessness or error on the part of the operator can result in serious injury. This machine is capable of amputating fingers, hands, toes and feet and throwing objects. Failure to observe the following safety instructions could result in serious injury or death.\n\n### General Operation",
            "1. Read this operator's manual carefully in its entirety before attempting to assemble this machine. Read, understand, and follow all instructions on the machine and in the manual(s) before operation. Keep this manual in a safe place for future and regular reference and for ordering replacement parts.\n2. Be completely familiar with the controls and the proper use of this machine before operating it.\n3. This machine is a precision piece of power equipment, not a plaything. Therefore, exercise extreme caution at all times. This machine has been designed to perform one job: to mow grass. Do not use it for any other purpose.\n4. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and should be trained and supervised by an adult.\n5. Only responsible individuals who are familiar with these rules of safe operation should be allowed to use this machine.\n6. Thoroughly inspect the area where the equipment is to be used. Remove all stones, sticks, wire, bones, toys and other foreign objects, which could be tripped over or picked up and thrown by the blade. Thrown objects can cause serious personal injury.\n7. Plan your mowing pattern to avoid discharge of material toward roads, sidewalks, bystanders and the like. Also, avoid discharging material against a wall or obstruction, which may cause discharged material to ricochet back toward the operator.\n8. To help avoid blade contact or a thrown object injury, stay in operator zone behind handles and keep children, bystanders, helpers and pets at least 75 feet from mower while it is in operation. Stop machine if anyone enters area.\n9. Always wear safety glasses or safety goggles during operation and while performing an adjustment or repair to protect your eyes. Thrown objects which ricochet can cause serious injury to the eyes.\n10. Wear sturdy, rough-soled work shoes and close-fitting slacks and shirts. Shirts and pants that cover the arms and legs and steel-toed shoes are recommended. Never operate this machine in bare feet, sandals, slippery or lightweight (e.g., canvas) shoes.\n11. Do not put hands or feet near rotating parts or under the cutting deck. Contact with blade can amputate fingers, hands, toes and feet.\n12. A missing or damaged discharge cover can cause blade contact or thrown object injuries.\n13. Many injuries occur as a result of the mower being pulled over the foot during a fall caused by slipping or tripping. Do not hold onto the mower if you are falling; release the handle immediately.\n14. Never pull the mower back toward you while you are walking. If you must back the mower away from a wall or obstruction first look down and behind to avoid tripping and then follow these steps:\n    - Step back from mower to fully extend your arms.\n    - Be sure you are well balanced with sure footing.\n    - Pull the mower back slowly, no more than halfway toward you.\n    - Repeat these steps as needed.\n15. Do not operate the mower while under the influence of alcohol or drugs.\n16. Do not engage the self-propelled mechanism on machines so equipped while starting engine.\n17. The blade control is a safety device. Never attempt to bypass its operation. Doing so makes the safety device inoperative and may result in personal injury through contact with the rotating blade. The blade control must operate easily in both directions and automatically return to the disengaged position when released.\n18. Never operate the mower in wet grass. Always be sure of your footing. A slip and fall can cause serious personal injury. If you feel you are losing your footing, release the blade control handle immediately and the blade will stop rotating within three seconds.\n19. Mow only in daylight or good artificial light. Walk, never run.\n20. Stop the blade when crossing gravel drives, walks or roads.\n21. If the equipment should start to vibrate abnormally, stop the engine and check immediately for the cause. Vibration is generally a warning of trouble.\n22. Shut the engine off and wait until the blade comes to a complete stop before removing the grass catcher or unclogging the chute. The cutting blade continues to rotate for a few seconds after the blade control is released. Never place any part of the body in the blade area until you are sure the blade has stopped rotating.\n23. Never operate mower without proper trail shield, discharge cover, grass catcher, blade control or other safety protective devices in place and working. Never operate mower with damaged safety devices. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.\n24. Muffler and engine become hot and can cause a burn. Do not touch.\n25. Never attempt to make a wheel or cutting height adjustment while the engine is running.\n26. Only use parts and accessories made for this machine by the manufacturer. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.",
            "27. When starting engine, pull cord slowly until resistance is felt, then pull rapidly. Rapid retraction of starter cord (kickback) will pull hand and arm toward engine faster than you can let go. Broken bones, fractures, bruises or sprains could result.\n28. If situations occur which are not covered in this manual, use care and good judgment. Contact Customer Support for assistance and the name of your nearest servicing dealer.",
            "### Children\n\nTragic accidents can occur if the operator is not alert to the presence of children. Children are often attracted to the mower and the mowing activity. They do not understand the dangers. Never assume that children will remain where you last saw them.\n\n1. Keep children out of the mowing area and under watchful care of a responsible adult other than the operator.\n2. Be alert and turn mower off if a child enters the area.\n3. Before and while moving backwards, look behind and down for small children.\n4. Use extreme care when approaching blind corners, doorways, shrubs, trees, or other objects that may block your vision of a child who may run into the mower.\n5. Keep children away from hot or running engines. They can suffer burns from a hot muffler.\n6. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and be trained and supervised by an adult.\n\n### Service\n\nSafe Handling of Gasoline\n\nTo avoid personal injury or property damage, use extreme care in handling gasoline. Gasoline is extremely flammable and the vapors are explosive. Serious personal injury can occur when gasoline is spilled on yourself or your clothes, which can ignite. Wash your skin and change clothes immediately.\n\n1. Use only an approved gasoline container.\n2. Never fill containers inside a vehicle or on a truck or trailer bed with a plastic liner. Always place containers on the ground away from your vehicle before filling.\n3. Remove gas-powered equipment from the truck or trailer and refuel it on the ground. If this is not possible, then refuel such equipment on a trailer with a portable container, rather than from a gasoline dispenser nozzle.\n4. Keep the nozzle in contact with the rim of the fuel tank or container opening at all times until fueling is complete. Do not use a nozzle lock-open device.\n5. Extinguish all cigarettes, cigars, pipes and other sources of ignition.\n6. Never fuel machine indoors because flammable vapors will accumulate in the area.\n7. Never remove gas cap or add fuel while the engine is hot or running. Allow engine to cool at least two minutes before refueling.\n8. Never overfill fuel tank. Fill tank to no more than \u00bd inch below bottom of filler neck to provide space for fuel expansion.\n9. Replace gasoline cap and tighten securely.\n10. If gasoline is spilled, wipe it off the engine and equipment. Move machine to another area. Wait 5 minutes before starting engine.\n11. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light (e.g. furnace, water heater, space heater, clothes dryer, etc.).\n12. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n13. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light such as a water heater, furnace, clothes dryer etc.\n14. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n\n---\n\n## General Service\n\n1. Never run an engine indoors or in a poorly ventilated area. Engine exhaust contains carbon monoxide, an odorless and deadly gas.\n2. Before cleaning, repairing, or inspecting, make certain the blade and all moving parts have stopped. Disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine to prevent unintended starting.\n3. Check the blade and engine mounting bolts at frequent intervals for proper tightness. Also, visually inspect blade for damage (e.g., bent, cracked, worn). Replace blade with the original equipment manufacturer\u2019s (O.E.M.) blade only, listed in this manual. \u201cUse of parts which do not meet the original equipment specifications may lead to improper performance and compromise safety!\u201d\n4. Mower blades are sharp and can cut. Wrap the blade or wear gloves, and use extra caution when servicing them.\n5. Keep all nuts, bolts, and screws tight to be sure the equipment is in safe working condition.\n6. Never tamper with safety devices. Check their proper operation regularly.\n7. After striking a foreign object, stop the engine, disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine. Thoroughly inspect the mower for any damage. Repair the damage before starting and operating the mower.\n8. Never attempt to make adjustments or repairs to the mower while the engine is running.\n9. Grass catcher components are subject to wear, damage and deterioration, which could expose moving parts or allow objects to be thrown. Frequently check components and replace with the manufacturer\u2019s recommended parts when necessary.\n10. Mower blades are sharp and can cut. Wrap the blade or wear gloves, and use extra caution when servicing them.\n11. Do not change the engine governor setting or over-speed the engine.

            "### DANGER\n\nThis machine was built to be operated according to the safe operation practices in this manual. As with any type of power equipment, carelessness or error on the part of the operator can result in serious injury. This machine is capable of amputating fingers, hands, toes and feet and throwing objects. Failure to observe the following safety instructions could result in serious injury or death.\n\n### General Operation",
            "1. Read this operator's manual carefully in its entirety before attempting to assemble this machine. Read, understand, and follow all instructions on the machine and in the manual(s) before operation. Keep this manual in a safe place for future and regular reference and for ordering replacement parts.\n2. Be completely familiar with the controls and the proper use of this machine before operating it.\n3. This machine is a precision piece of power equipment, not a plaything. Therefore, exercise extreme caution at all times. This machine has been designed to perform one job: to mow grass. Do not use it for any other purpose.\n4. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and should be trained and supervised by an adult.\n5. Only responsible individuals who are familiar with these rules of safe operation should be allowed to use this machine.\n6. Thoroughly inspect the area where the equipment is to be used. Remove all stones, sticks, wire, bones, toys and other foreign objects, which could be tripped over or picked up and thrown by the blade. Thrown objects can cause serious personal injury.\n7. Plan your mowing pattern to avoid discharge of material toward roads, sidewalks, bystanders and the like. Also, avoid discharging material against a wall or obstruction, which may cause discharged material to ricochet back toward the operator.\n8. To help avoid blade contact or a thrown object injury, stay in operator zone behind handles and keep children, bystanders, helpers and pets at least 75 feet from mower while it is in operation. Stop machine if anyone enters area.\n9. Always wear safety glasses or safety goggles during operation and while performing an adjustment or repair to protect your eyes. Thrown objects which ricochet can cause serious injury to the eyes.\n10. Wear sturdy, rough-soled work shoes and close-fitting slacks and shirts. Shirts and pants that cover the arms and legs and steel-toed shoes are recommended. Never operate this machine in bare feet, sandals, slippery or lightweight (e.g., canvas) shoes.\n11. Do not put hands or feet near rotating parts or under the cutting deck. Contact with blade can amputate fingers, hands, toes and feet.\n12. A missing or damaged discharge cover can cause blade contact or thrown object injuries.\n13. Many injuries occur as a result of the mower being pulled over the foot during a fall caused by slipping or tripping. Do not hold onto the mower if you are falling; release the handle immediately.\n14. Never pull the mower back toward you while you are walking. If you must back the mower away from a wall or obstruction first look down and behind to avoid tripping and then follow these steps:\n    - Step back from mower to fully extend your arms.\n    - Be sure you are well balanced with sure footing.\n    - Pull the mower back slowly, no more than halfway toward you.\n    - Repeat these steps as needed.\n15. Do not operate the mower while under the influence of alcohol or drugs.\n16. Do not engage the self-propelled mechanism on machines so equipped while starting engine.\n17. The blade control is a safety device. Never attempt to bypass its operation. Doing so makes the safety device inoperative and may result in personal injury through contact with the rotating blade. The blade control must operate easily in both directions and automatically return to the disengaged position when released.\n18. Never operate the mower in wet grass. Always be sure of your footing. A slip and fall can cause serious personal injury. If you feel you are losing your footing, release the blade control handle immediately and the blade will stop rotating within three seconds.\n19. Mow only in daylight or good artificial light. Walk, never run.\n20. Stop the blade when crossing gravel drives, walks or roads.\n21. If the equipment should start to vibrate abnormally, stop the engine and check immediately for the cause. Vibration is generally a warning of trouble.\n22. Shut the engine off and wait until the blade comes to a complete stop before removing the grass catcher or unclogging the chute. The cutting blade continues to rotate for a few seconds after the blade control is released. Never place any part of the body in the blade area until you are sure the blade has stopped rotating.\n23. Never operate mower without proper trail shield, discharge cover, grass catcher, blade control or other safety protective devices in place and working. Never operate mower with damaged safety devices. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.\n24. Muffler and engine become hot and can cause a burn. Do not touch.\n25. Never attempt to make a wheel or cutting height adjustment while the engine is running.\n26. Only use parts and accessories made for this machine by the manufacturer. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.",
            "27. When starting engine, pull cord slowly until resistance is felt, then pull rapidly. Rapid retraction of starter cord (kickback) will pull hand and arm toward engine faster than you can let go. Broken bones, fractures, bruises or sprains could result.\n28. If situations occur which are not covered in this manual, use care and good judgment. Contact Customer Support for assistance and the name of your nearest servicing dealer.",
            "### Children\n\nTragic accidents can occur if the operator is not alert to the presence of children. Children are often attracted to the mower and the mowing activity. They do not understand the dangers. Never assume that children will remain where you last saw them.\n\n1. Keep children out of the mowing area and under watchful care of a responsible adult other than the operator.\n2. Be alert and turn mower off if a child enters the area.\n3. Before and while moving backwards, look behind and down for small children.\n4. Use extreme care when approaching blind corners, doorways, shrubs, trees, or other objects that may block your vision of a child who may run into the mower.\n5. Keep children away from hot or running engines. They can suffer burns from a hot muffler.\n6. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and be trained and supervised by an adult.\n\n### Service\n\nSafe Handling of Gasoline\n\nTo avoid personal injury or property damage, use extreme care in handling gasoline. Gasoline is extremely flammable and the vapors are explosive. Serious personal injury can occur when gasoline is spilled on yourself or your clothes, which can ignite. Wash your skin and change clothes immediately.\n\n1. Use only an approved gasoline container.\n2. Never fill containers inside a vehicle or on a truck or trailer bed with a plastic liner. Always place containers on the ground away from your vehicle before filling.\n3. Remove gas-powered equipment from the truck or trailer and refuel it on the ground. If this is not possible, then refuel such equipment on a trailer with a portable container, rather than from a gasoline dispenser nozzle.\n4. Keep the nozzle in contact with the rim of the fuel tank or container opening at all times until fueling is complete. Do not use a nozzle lock-open device.\n5. Extinguish all cigarettes, cigars, pipes and other sources of ignition.\n6. Never fuel machine indoors because flammable vapors will accumulate in the area.\n7. Never remove gas cap or add fuel while the engine is hot or running. Allow engine to cool at least two minutes before refueling.\n8. Never overfill fuel tank. Fill tank to no more than \u00bd inch below bottom of filler neck to provide space for fuel expansion.\n9. Replace gasoline cap and tighten securely.\n10. If gasoline is spilled, wipe it off the engine and equipment. Move machine to another area. Wait 5 minutes before starting engine.\n11. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light (e.g. furnace, water heater, space heater, clothes dryer, etc.).\n12. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n13. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light such as a water heater, furnace, clothes dryer etc.\n14. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n\n---\n\n## General Service\n\n1. Never run an engine indoors or in a poorly ventilated area. Engine exhaust contains carbon monoxide, an odorless and deadly gas.\n2. Before cleaning, repairing, or inspecting, make certain the blade and all moving parts have stopped. Disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine to prevent unintended starting.\n3. Check the blade and engine mounting bolts at frequent intervals for proper tightness. Also, visually inspect blade for damage (e.g., bent, cracked, worn). Replace blade with the original equipment manufacturer\u2019s (O.E.M.) blade only, listed in this manual. \u201cUse of parts which do not meet the original equipment specifications may lead to improper performance and compromise safety!\u201d\n4. Mower blades are sharp and can cut. Wrap the blade or wear gloves, and use extra caution when servicing them.\n5. Keep all nuts, bolts, and screws tight to be sure the equipment is in safe working condition.\n6. Never tamper with safety devices. Check their proper operation regularly.\n7. After striking a foreign object, stop the engine, disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine. Thoroughly inspect the mower for any damage. Repair the damage before starting and operating the mower.\n8. Never attempt to make adjustments or repairs to the mower while the engine is running.\n9. Grass catcher components are subject to wear, damage and deterioration, which could expose moving parts or allow objects to be thrown. Frequently check components and replace with the manufacturer\u2019s recommended parts when necessary.\n10. Mower blades are sharp and can cut.

            "### DANGER\n\nThis machine was built to be operated according to the safe operation practices in this manual. As with any type of power equipment, carelessness or error on the part of the operator can result in serious injury. This machine is capable of amputating fingers, hands, toes and feet and throwing objects. Failure to observe the following safety instructions could result in serious injury or death.\n\n### General Operation",
            "1. Read this operator's manual carefully in its entirety before attempting to assemble this machine. Read, understand, and follow all instructions on the machine and in the manual(s) before operation. Keep this manual in a safe place for future and regular reference and for ordering replacement parts.\n2. Be completely familiar with the controls and the proper use of this machine before operating it.\n3. This machine is a precision piece of power equipment, not a plaything. Therefore, exercise extreme caution at all times. This machine has been designed to perform one job: to mow grass. Do not use it for any other purpose.\n4. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and should be trained and supervised by an adult.\n5. Only responsible individuals who are familiar with these rules of safe operation should be allowed to use this machine.\n6. Thoroughly inspect the area where the equipment is to be used. Remove all stones, sticks, wire, bones, toys and other foreign objects, which could be tripped over or picked up and thrown by the blade. Thrown objects can cause serious personal injury.\n7. Plan your mowing pattern to avoid discharge of material toward roads, sidewalks, bystanders and the like. Also, avoid discharging material against a wall or obstruction, which may cause discharged material to ricochet back toward the operator.\n8. To help avoid blade contact or a thrown object injury, stay in operator zone behind handles and keep children, bystanders, helpers and pets at least 75 feet from mower while it is in operation. Stop machine if anyone enters area.\n9. Always wear safety glasses or safety goggles during operation and while performing an adjustment or repair to protect your eyes. Thrown objects which ricochet can cause serious injury to the eyes.\n10. Wear sturdy, rough-soled work shoes and close-fitting slacks and shirts. Shirts and pants that cover the arms and legs and steel-toed shoes are recommended. Never operate this machine in bare feet, sandals, slippery or lightweight (e.g., canvas) shoes.\n11. Do not put hands or feet near rotating parts or under the cutting deck. Contact with blade can amputate fingers, hands, toes and feet.\n12. A missing or damaged discharge cover can cause blade contact or thrown object injuries.\n13. Many injuries occur as a result of the mower being pulled over the foot during a fall caused by slipping or tripping. Do not hold onto the mower if you are falling; release the handle immediately.\n14. Never pull the mower back toward you while you are walking. If you must back the mower away from a wall or obstruction first look down and behind to avoid tripping and then follow these steps:\n    - Step back from mower to fully extend your arms.\n    - Be sure you are well balanced with sure footing.\n    - Pull the mower back slowly, no more than halfway toward you.\n    - Repeat these steps as needed.\n15. Do not operate the mower while under the influence of alcohol or drugs.\n16. Do not engage the self-propelled mechanism on machines so equipped while starting engine.\n17. The blade control is a safety device. Never attempt to bypass its operation. Doing so makes the safety device inoperative and may result in personal injury through contact with the rotating blade. The blade control must operate easily in both directions and automatically return to the disengaged position when released.\n18. Never operate the mower in wet grass. Always be sure of your footing. A slip and fall can cause serious personal injury. If you feel you are losing your footing, release the blade control handle immediately and the blade will stop rotating within three seconds.\n19. Mow only in daylight or good artificial light. Walk, never run.\n20. Stop the blade when crossing gravel drives, walks or roads.\n21. If the equipment should start to vibrate abnormally, stop the engine and check immediately for the cause. Vibration is generally a warning of trouble.\n22. Shut the engine off and wait until the blade comes to a complete stop before removing the grass catcher or unclogging the chute. The cutting blade continues to rotate for a few seconds after the blade control is released. Never place any part of the body in the blade area until you are sure the blade has stopped rotating.\n23. Never operate mower without proper trail shield, discharge cover, grass catcher, blade control or other safety protective devices in place and working. Never operate mower with damaged safety devices. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.\n24. Muffler and engine become hot and can cause a burn. Do not touch.\n25. Never attempt to make a wheel or cutting height adjustment while the engine is running.\n26. Only use parts and accessories made for this machine by the manufacturer. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.",
            "27. When starting engine, pull cord slowly until resistance is felt, then pull rapidly. Rapid retraction of starter cord (kickback) will pull hand and arm toward engine faster than you can let go. Broken bones, fractures, bruises or sprains could result.\n28. If situations occur which are not covered in this manual, use care and good judgment. Contact Customer Support for assistance and the name of your nearest servicing dealer.",
            "### Children\n\nTragic accidents can occur if the operator is not alert to the presence of children. Children are often attracted to the mower and the mowing activity. They do not understand the dangers. Never assume that children will remain where you last saw them.\n\n1. Keep children out of the mowing area and under watchful care of a responsible adult other than the operator.\n2. Be alert and turn mower off if a child enters the area.\n3. Before and while moving backwards, look behind and down for small children.\n4. Use extreme care when approaching blind corners, doorways, shrubs, trees, or other objects that may block your vision of a child who may run into the mower.\n5. Keep children away from hot or running engines. They can suffer burns from a hot muffler.\n6. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and be trained and supervised by an adult.\n\n### Service\n\nSafe Handling of Gasoline\n\nTo avoid personal injury or property damage, use extreme care in handling gasoline. Gasoline is extremely flammable and the vapors are explosive. Serious personal injury can occur when gasoline is spilled on yourself or your clothes, which can ignite. Wash your skin and change clothes immediately.\n\n1. Use only an approved gasoline container.\n2. Never fill containers inside a vehicle or on a truck or trailer bed with a plastic liner. Always place containers on the ground away from your vehicle before filling.\n3. Remove gas-powered equipment from the truck or trailer and refuel it on the ground. If this is not possible, then refuel such equipment on a trailer with a portable container, rather than from a gasoline dispenser nozzle.\n4. Keep the nozzle in contact with the rim of the fuel tank or container opening at all times until fueling is complete. Do not use a nozzle lock-open device.\n5. Extinguish all cigarettes, cigars, pipes and other sources of ignition.\n6. Never fuel machine indoors because flammable vapors will accumulate in the area.\n7. Never remove gas cap or add fuel while the engine is hot or running. Allow engine to cool at least two minutes before refueling.\n8. Never overfill fuel tank. Fill tank to no more than \u00bd inch below bottom of filler neck to provide space for fuel expansion.\n9. Replace gasoline cap and tighten securely.\n10. If gasoline is spilled, wipe it off the engine and equipment. Move machine to another area. Wait 5 minutes before starting engine.\n11. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light (e.g. furnace, water heater, space heater, clothes dryer, etc.).\n12. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n13. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light such as a water heater, furnace, clothes dryer etc.\n14. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n\n---\n\n## General Service\n\n1. Never run an engine indoors or in a poorly ventilated area. Engine exhaust contains carbon monoxide, an odorless and deadly gas.\n2. Before cleaning, repairing, or inspecting, make certain the blade and all moving parts have stopped. Disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine to prevent unintended starting.\n3. Check the blade and engine mounting bolts at frequent intervals for proper tightness. Also, visually inspect blade for damage (e.g., bent, cracked, worn). Replace blade with the original equipment manufacturer\u2019s (O.E.M.) blade only, listed in this manual. \u201cUse of parts which do not meet the original equipment specifications may lead to improper performance and compromise safety!\u201d\n4. Mower blades are sharp and can cut. Wrap the blade or wear gloves, and use extra caution when servicing them.\n5. Keep all nuts, bolts, and screws tight to be sure the equipment is in safe working condition.\n6. Never tamper with safety devices. Check their proper operation regularly.\n7. After striking a foreign object, stop the engine, disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine. Thoroughly inspect the mower for any damage. Repair the damage before starting and operating the mower.\n8. Never attempt to make adjustments or repairs to the mower while the engine is running.\n9. Grass catcher components are subject to wear, damage and deterioration, which could expose moving parts or allow objects to be thrown. Frequently check components and replace with the manufacturer\u2019s recommended parts when necessary.\n10. Mower blades are sharp and can cut.

            "### DANGER\n\nThis machine was built to be operated according to the safe operation practices in this manual. As with any type of power equipment, carelessness or error on the part of the operator can result in serious injury. This machine is capable of amputating fingers, hands, toes and feet and throwing objects. Failure to observe the following safety instructions could result in serious injury or death.\n\n### General Operation",
            "1. Read this operator's manual carefully in its entirety before attempting to assemble this machine. Read, understand, and follow all instructions on the machine and in the manual(s) before operation. Keep this manual in a safe place for future and regular reference and for ordering replacement parts.\n2. Be completely familiar with the controls and the proper use of this machine before operating it.\n3. This machine is a precision piece of power equipment, not a plaything. Therefore, exercise extreme caution at all times. This machine has been designed to perform one job: to mow grass. Do not use it for any other purpose.\n4. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and should be trained and supervised by an adult.\n5. Only responsible individuals who are familiar with these rules of safe operation should be allowed to use this machine.\n6. Thoroughly inspect the area where the equipment is to be used. Remove all stones, sticks, wire, bones, toys and other foreign objects, which could be tripped over or picked up and thrown by the blade. Thrown objects can cause serious personal injury.\n7. Plan your mowing pattern to avoid discharge of material toward roads, sidewalks, bystanders and the like. Also, avoid discharging material against a wall or obstruction, which may cause discharged material to ricochet back toward the operator.\n8. To help avoid blade contact or a thrown object injury, stay in operator zone behind handles and keep children, bystanders, helpers and pets at least 75 feet from mower while it is in operation. Stop machine if anyone enters area.\n9. Always wear safety glasses or safety goggles during operation and while performing an adjustment or repair to protect your eyes. Thrown objects which ricochet can cause serious injury to the eyes.\n10. Wear sturdy, rough-soled work shoes and close-fitting slacks and shirts. Shirts and pants that cover the arms and legs and steel-toed shoes are recommended. Never operate this machine in bare feet, sandals, slippery or lightweight (e.g., canvas) shoes.\n11. Do not put hands or feet near rotating parts or under the cutting deck. Contact with blade can amputate fingers, hands, toes and feet.\n12. A missing or damaged discharge cover can cause blade contact or thrown object injuries.\n13. Many injuries occur as a result of the mower being pulled over the foot during a fall caused by slipping or tripping. Do not hold onto the mower if you are falling; release the handle immediately.\n14. Never pull the mower back toward you while you are walking. If you must back the mower away from a wall or obstruction first look down and behind to avoid tripping and then follow these steps:\n    - Step back from mower to fully extend your arms.\n    - Be sure you are well balanced with sure footing.\n    - Pull the mower back slowly, no more than halfway toward you.\n    - Repeat these steps as needed.\n15. Do not operate the mower while under the influence of alcohol or drugs.\n16. Do not engage the self-propelled mechanism on machines so equipped while starting engine.\n17. The blade control is a safety device. Never attempt to bypass its operation. Doing so makes the safety device inoperative and may result in personal injury through contact with the rotating blade. The blade control must operate easily in both directions and automatically return to the disengaged position when released.\n18. Never operate the mower in wet grass. Always be sure of your footing. A slip and fall can cause serious personal injury. If you feel you are losing your footing, release the blade control handle immediately and the blade will stop rotating within three seconds.\n19. Mow only in daylight or good artificial light. Walk, never run.\n20. Stop the blade when crossing gravel drives, walks or roads.\n21. If the equipment should start to vibrate abnormally, stop the engine and check immediately for the cause. Vibration is generally a warning of trouble.\n22. Shut the engine off and wait until the blade comes to a complete stop before removing the grass catcher or unclogging the chute. The cutting blade continues to rotate for a few seconds after the blade control is released. Never place any part of the body in the blade area until you are sure the blade has stopped rotating.\n23. Never operate mower without proper trail shield, discharge cover, grass catcher, blade control or other safety protective devices in place and working. Never operate mower with damaged safety devices. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.\n24. Muffler and engine become hot and can cause a burn. Do not touch.\n25. Never attempt to make a wheel or cutting height adjustment while the engine is running.\n26. Only use parts and accessories made for this machine by the manufacturer. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.",
            "27. When starting engine, pull cord slowly until resistance is felt, then pull rapidly. Rapid retraction of starter cord (kickback) will pull hand and arm toward engine faster than you can let go. Broken bones, fractures, bruises or sprains could result.\n28. If situations occur which are not covered in this manual, use care and good judgment. Contact Customer Support for assistance and the name of your nearest servicing dealer.",
            "### Children\n\nTragic accidents can occur if the operator is not alert to the presence of children. Children are often attracted to the mower and the mowing activity. They do not understand the dangers. Never assume that children will remain where you last saw them.\n\n1. Keep children out of the mowing area and under watchful care of a responsible adult other than the operator.\n2. Be alert and turn mower off if a child enters the area.\n3. Before and while moving backwards, look behind and down for small children.\n4. Use extreme care when approaching blind corners, doorways, shrubs, trees, or other objects that may block your vision of a child who may run into the mower.\n5. Keep children away from hot or running engines. They can suffer burns from a hot muffler.\n6. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and be trained and supervised by an adult.\n\n### Service\n\nSafe Handling of Gasoline\n\nTo avoid personal injury or property damage, use extreme care in handling gasoline. Gasoline is extremely flammable and the vapors are explosive. Serious personal injury can occur when gasoline is spilled on yourself or your clothes, which can ignite. Wash your skin and change clothes immediately.\n\n1. Use only an approved gasoline container.\n2. Never fill containers inside a vehicle or on a truck or trailer bed with a plastic liner. Always place containers on the ground away from your vehicle before filling.\n3. Remove gas-powered equipment from the truck or trailer and refuel it on the ground. If this is not possible, then refuel such equipment on a trailer with a portable container, rather than from a gasoline dispenser nozzle.\n4. Keep the nozzle in contact with the rim of the fuel tank or container opening at all times until fueling is complete. Do not use a nozzle lock-open device.\n5. Extinguish all cigarettes, cigars, pipes and other sources of ignition.\n6. Never fuel machine indoors because flammable vapors will accumulate in the area.\n7. Never remove gas cap or add fuel while the engine is hot or running. Allow engine to cool at least two minutes before refueling.\n8. Never overfill fuel tank. Fill tank to no more than \u00bd inch below bottom of filler neck to provide space for fuel expansion.\n9. Replace gasoline cap and tighten securely.\n10. If gasoline is spilled, wipe it off the engine and equipment. Move machine to another area. Wait 5 minutes before starting engine.\n11. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light (e.g. furnace, water heater, space heater, clothes dryer, etc.).\n12. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n13. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light such as a water heater, furnace, clothes dryer etc.\n14. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n\n---\n\n## General Service\n\n1. Never run an engine indoors or in a poorly ventilated area. Engine exhaust contains carbon monoxide, an odorless and deadly gas.\n2. Before cleaning, repairing, or inspecting, make certain the blade and all moving parts have stopped. Disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine to prevent unintended starting.\n3. Check the blade and engine mounting bolts at frequent intervals for proper tightness. Also, visually inspect blade for damage (e.g., bent, cracked, worn). Replace blade with the original equipment manufacturer\u2019s (O.E.M.) blade only, listed in this manual. \u201cUse of parts which do not meet the original equipment specifications may lead to improper performance and compromise safety!\u201d\n4. Mower blades are sharp and can cut. Wrap the blade or wear gloves, and use extra caution when servicing them.\n5. Keep all nuts, bolts, and screws tight to be sure the equipment is in safe working condition.\n6. Never tamper with safety devices. Check their proper operation regularly.\n7. After striking a foreign object, stop the engine, disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine. Thoroughly inspect the mower for any damage. Repair the damage before starting and operating the mower.\n8. Never attempt to make adjustments or repairs to the mower while the engine is running.\n9. Grass catcher components are subject to wear, damage and deterioration, which could expose moving parts or allow objects to be thrown. Frequently check components and replace with the manufacturer\u2019s recommended parts when necessary.\n10. Mower blades are sharp and can cut.

            "### DANGER\n\nThis machine was built to be operated according to the safe operation practices in this manual. As with any type of power equipment, carelessness or error on the part of the operator can result in serious injury. This machine is capable of amputating fingers, hands, toes and feet and throwing objects. Failure to observe the following safety instructions could result in serious injury or death.\n\n### General Operation",
            "1. Read this operator's manual carefully in its entirety before attempting to assemble this machine. Read, understand, and follow all instructions on the machine and in the manual(s) before operation. Keep this manual in a safe place for future and regular reference and for ordering replacement parts.\n2. Be completely familiar with the controls and the proper use of this machine before operating it.\n3. This machine is a precision piece of power equipment, not a plaything. Therefore, exercise extreme caution at all times. This machine has been designed to perform one job: to mow grass. Do not use it for any other purpose.\n4. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and should be trained and supervised by an adult.\n5. Only responsible individuals who are familiar with these rules of safe operation should be allowed to use this machine.\n6. Thoroughly inspect the area where the equipment is to be used. Remove all stones, sticks, wire, bones, toys and other foreign objects, which could be tripped over or picked up and thrown by the blade. Thrown objects can cause serious personal injury.\n7. Plan your mowing pattern to avoid discharge of material toward roads, sidewalks, bystanders and the like. Also, avoid discharging material against a wall or obstruction, which may cause discharged material to ricochet back toward the operator.\n8. To help avoid blade contact or a thrown object injury, stay in operator zone behind handles and keep children, bystanders, helpers and pets at least 75 feet from mower while it is in operation. Stop machine if anyone enters area.\n9. Always wear safety glasses or safety goggles during operation and while performing an adjustment or repair to protect your eyes. Thrown objects which ricochet can cause serious injury to the eyes.\n10. Wear sturdy, rough-soled work shoes and close-fitting slacks and shirts. Shirts and pants that cover the arms and legs and steel-toed shoes are recommended. Never operate this machine in bare feet, sandals, slippery or lightweight (e.g., canvas) shoes.\n11. Do not put hands or feet near rotating parts or under the cutting deck. Contact with blade can amputate fingers, hands, toes and feet.\n12. A missing or damaged discharge cover can cause blade contact or thrown object injuries.\n13. Many injuries occur as a result of the mower being pulled over the foot during a fall caused by slipping or tripping. Do not hold onto the mower if you are falling; release the handle immediately.\n14. Never pull the mower back toward you while you are walking. If you must back the mower away from a wall or obstruction first look down and behind to avoid tripping and then follow these steps:\n    - Step back from mower to fully extend your arms.\n    - Be sure you are well balanced with sure footing.\n    - Pull the mower back slowly, no more than halfway toward you.\n    - Repeat these steps as needed.\n15. Do not operate the mower while under the influence of alcohol or drugs.\n16. Do not engage the self-propelled mechanism on machines so equipped while starting engine.\n17. The blade control is a safety device. Never attempt to bypass its operation. Doing so makes the safety device inoperative and may result in personal injury through contact with the rotating blade. The blade control must operate easily in both directions and automatically return to the disengaged position when released.\n18. Never operate the mower in wet grass. Always be sure of your footing. A slip and fall can cause serious personal injury. If you feel you are losing your footing, release the blade control handle immediately and the blade will stop rotating within three seconds.\n19. Mow only in daylight or good artificial light. Walk, never run.\n20. Stop the blade when crossing gravel drives, walks or roads.\n21. If the equipment should start to vibrate abnormally, stop the engine and check immediately for the cause. Vibration is generally a warning of trouble.\n22. Shut the engine off and wait until the blade comes to a complete stop before removing the grass catcher or unclogging the chute. The cutting blade continues to rotate for a few seconds after the blade control is released. Never place any part of the body in the blade area until you are sure the blade has stopped rotating.\n23. Never operate mower without proper trail shield, discharge cover, grass catcher, blade control or other safety protective devices in place and working. Never operate mower with damaged safety devices. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.\n24. Muffler and engine become hot and can cause a burn. Do not touch.\n25. Never attempt to make a wheel or cutting height adjustment while the engine is running.\n26. Only use parts and accessories made for this machine by the manufacturer. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.",
            "27. When starting engine, pull cord slowly until resistance is felt, then pull rapidly. Rapid retraction of starter cord (kickback) will pull hand and arm toward engine faster than you can let go. Broken bones, fractures, bruises or sprains could result.\n28. If situations occur which are not covered in this manual, use care and good judgment. Contact Customer Support for assistance and the name of your nearest servicing dealer.",
            "### Children\n\nTragic accidents can occur if the operator is not alert to the presence of children. Children are often attracted to the mower and the mowing activity. They do not understand the dangers. Never assume that children will remain where you last saw them.\n\n1. Keep children out of the mowing area and under watchful care of a responsible adult other than the operator.\n2. Be alert and turn mower off if a child enters the area.\n3. Before and while moving backwards, look behind and down for small children.\n4. Use extreme care when approaching blind corners, doorways, shrubs, trees, or other objects that may block your vision of a child who may run into the mower.\n5. Keep children away from hot or running engines. They can suffer burns from a hot muffler.\n6. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and be trained and supervised by an adult.\n\n### Service\n\nSafe Handling of Gasoline\n\nTo avoid personal injury or property damage, use extreme care in handling gasoline. Gasoline is extremely flammable and the vapors are explosive. Serious personal injury can occur when gasoline is spilled on yourself or your clothes, which can ignite. Wash your skin and change clothes immediately.\n\n1. Use only an approved gasoline container.\n2. Never fill containers inside a vehicle or on a truck or trailer bed with a plastic liner. Always place containers on the ground away from your vehicle before filling.\n3. Remove gas-powered equipment from the truck or trailer and refuel it on the ground. If this is not possible, then refuel such equipment on a trailer with a portable container, rather than from a gasoline dispenser nozzle.\n4. Keep the nozzle in contact with the rim of the fuel tank or container opening at all times until fueling is complete. Do not use a nozzle lock-open device.\n5. Extinguish all cigarettes, cigars, pipes and other sources of ignition.\n6. Never fuel machine indoors because flammable vapors will accumulate in the area.\n7. Never remove gas cap or add fuel while the engine is hot or running. Allow engine to cool at least two minutes before refueling.\n8. Never overfill fuel tank. Fill tank to no more than \u00bd inch below bottom of filler neck to provide space for fuel expansion.\n9. Replace gasoline cap and tighten securely.\n10. If gasoline is spilled, wipe it off the engine and equipment. Move machine to another area. Wait 5 minutes before starting engine.\n11. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light (e.g. furnace, water heater, space heater, clothes dryer, etc.).\n12. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n13. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light such as a water heater, furnace, clothes dryer etc.\n14. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n\n---\n\n## General Service\n\n1. Never run an engine indoors or in a poorly ventilated area. Engine exhaust contains carbon monoxide, an odorless and deadly gas.\n2. Before cleaning, repairing, or inspecting, make certain the blade and all moving parts have stopped. Disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine to prevent unintended starting.\n3. Check the blade and engine mounting bolts at frequent intervals for proper tightness. Also, visually inspect blade for damage (e.g., bent, cracked, worn). Replace blade with the original equipment manufacturer\u2019s (O.E.M.) blade only, listed in this manual. \u201cUse of parts which do not meet the original equipment specifications may lead to improper performance and compromise safety!\u201d\n4. Mower blades are sharp and can cut. Wrap the blade or wear gloves, and use extra caution when servicing them.\n5. Keep all nuts, bolts, and screws tight to be sure the equipment is in safe working condition.\n6. Never tamper with safety devices. Check their proper operation regularly.\n7. After striking a foreign object, stop the engine, disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine. Thoroughly inspect the mower for any damage. Repair the damage before starting and operating the mower.\n8. Never attempt to make adjustments or repairs to the mower while the engine is running.\n9. Grass catcher components are subject to wear, damage and deterioration, which could expose moving parts or allow objects to be thrown. Frequently check components and replace with the manufacturer\u2019s recommended parts when necessary.\n10. Mower blades are sharp and can cut.

            "### DANGER\n\nThis machine was built to be operated according to the safe operation practices in this manual. As with any type of power equipment, carelessness or error on the part of the operator can result in serious injury. This machine is capable of amputating fingers, hands, toes and feet and throwing objects. Failure to observe the following safety instructions could result in serious injury or death.\n\n### General Operation",
            "1. Read this operator's manual carefully in its entirety before attempting to assemble this machine. Read, understand, and follow all instructions on the machine and in the manual(s) before operation. Keep this manual in a safe place for future and regular reference and for ordering replacement parts.\n2. Be completely familiar with the controls and the proper use of this machine before operating it.\n3. This machine is a precision piece of power equipment, not a plaything. Therefore, exercise extreme caution at all times. This machine has been designed to perform one job: to mow grass. Do not use it for any other purpose.\n4. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and should be trained and supervised by an adult.\n5. Only responsible individuals who are familiar with these rules of safe operation should be allowed to use this machine.\n6. Thoroughly inspect the area where the equipment is to be used. Remove all stones, sticks, wire, bones, toys and other foreign objects, which could be tripped over or picked up and thrown by the blade. Thrown objects can cause serious personal injury.\n7. Plan your mowing pattern to avoid discharge of material toward roads, sidewalks, bystanders and the like. Also, avoid discharging material against a wall or obstruction, which may cause discharged material to ricochet back toward the operator.\n8. To help avoid blade contact or a thrown object injury, stay in operator zone behind handles and keep children, bystanders, helpers and pets at least 75 feet from mower while it is in operation. Stop machine if anyone enters area.\n9. Always wear safety glasses or safety goggles during operation and while performing an adjustment or repair to protect your eyes. Thrown objects which ricochet can cause serious injury to the eyes.\n10. Wear sturdy, rough-soled work shoes and close-fitting slacks and shirts. Shirts and pants that cover the arms and legs and steel-toed shoes are recommended. Never operate this machine in bare feet, sandals, slippery or lightweight (e.g., canvas) shoes.\n11. Do not put hands or feet near rotating parts or under the cutting deck. Contact with blade can amputate fingers, hands, toes and feet.\n12. A missing or damaged discharge cover can cause blade contact or thrown object injuries.\n13. Many injuries occur as a result of the mower being pulled over the foot during a fall caused by slipping or tripping. Do not hold onto the mower if you are falling; release the handle immediately.\n14. Never pull the mower back toward you while you are walking. If you must back the mower away from a wall or obstruction first look down and behind to avoid tripping and then follow these steps:\n    - Step back from mower to fully extend your arms.\n    - Be sure you are well balanced with sure footing.\n    - Pull the mower back slowly, no more than halfway toward you.\n    - Repeat these steps as needed.\n15. Do not operate the mower while under the influence of alcohol or drugs.\n16. Do not engage the self-propelled mechanism on machines so equipped while starting engine.\n17. The blade control is a safety device. Never attempt to bypass its operation. Doing so makes the safety device inoperative and may result in personal injury through contact with the rotating blade. The blade control must operate easily in both directions and automatically return to the disengaged position when released.\n18. Never operate the mower in wet grass. Always be sure of your footing. A slip and fall can cause serious personal injury. If you feel you are losing your footing, release the blade control handle immediately and the blade will stop rotating within three seconds.\n19. Mow only in daylight or good artificial light. Walk, never run.\n20. Stop the blade when crossing gravel drives, walks or roads.\n21. If the equipment should start to vibrate abnormally, stop the engine and check immediately for the cause. Vibration is generally a warning of trouble.\n22. Shut the engine off and wait until the blade comes to a complete stop before removing the grass catcher or unclogging the chute. The cutting blade continues to rotate for a few seconds after the blade control is released. Never place any part of the body in the blade area until you are sure the blade has stopped rotating.\n23. Never operate mower without proper trail shield, discharge cover, grass catcher, blade control or other safety protective devices in place and working. Never operate mower with damaged safety devices. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.\n24. Muffler and engine become hot and can cause a burn. Do not touch.\n25. Never attempt to make a wheel or cutting height adjustment while the engine is running.\n26. Only use parts and accessories made for this machine by the manufacturer. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.",
            "27. When starting engine, pull cord slowly until resistance is felt, then pull rapidly. Rapid retraction of starter cord (kickback) will pull hand and arm toward engine faster than you can let go. Broken bones, fractures, bruises or sprains could result.\n28. If situations occur which are not covered in this manual, use care and good judgment. Contact Customer Support for assistance and the name of your nearest servicing dealer.",
            "### Children\n\nTragic accidents can occur if the operator is not alert to the presence of children. Children are often attracted to the mower and the mowing activity. They do not understand the dangers. Never assume that children will remain where you last saw them.\n\n1. Keep children out of the mowing area and under watchful care of a responsible adult other than the operator.\n2. Be alert and turn mower off if a child enters the area.\n3. Before and while moving backwards, look behind and down for small children.\n4. Use extreme care when approaching blind corners, doorways, shrubs, trees, or other objects that may block your vision of a child who may run into the mower.\n5. Keep children away from hot or running engines. They can suffer burns from a hot muffler.\n6. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and be trained and supervised by an adult.\n\n### Service\n\nSafe Handling of Gasoline\n\nTo avoid personal injury or property damage, use extreme care in handling gasoline. Gasoline is extremely flammable and the vapors are explosive. Serious personal injury can occur when gasoline is spilled on yourself or your clothes, which can ignite. Wash your skin and change clothes immediately.\n\n1. Use only an approved gasoline container.\n2. Never fill containers inside a vehicle or on a truck or trailer bed with a plastic liner. Always place containers on the ground away from your vehicle before filling.\n3. Remove gas-powered equipment from the truck or trailer and refuel it on the ground. If this is not possible, then refuel such equipment on a trailer with a portable container, rather than from a gasoline dispenser nozzle.\n4. Keep the nozzle in contact with the rim of the fuel tank or container opening at all times until fueling is complete. Do not use a nozzle lock-open device.\n5. Extinguish all cigarettes, cigars, pipes and other sources of ignition.\n6. Never fuel machine indoors because flammable vapors will accumulate in the area.\n7. Never remove gas cap or add fuel while the engine is hot or running. Allow engine to cool at least two minutes before refueling.\n8. Never overfill fuel tank. Fill tank to no more than \u00bd inch below bottom of filler neck to provide space for fuel expansion.\n9. Replace gasoline cap and tighten securely.\n10. If gasoline is spilled, wipe it off the engine and equipment. Move machine to another area. Wait 5 minutes before starting engine.\n11. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light (e.g. furnace, water heater, space heater, clothes dryer, etc.).\n12. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n13. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light such as a water heater, furnace, clothes dryer etc.\n14. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n\n---\n\n## General Service\n\n1. Never run an engine indoors or in a poorly ventilated area. Engine exhaust contains carbon monoxide, an odorless and deadly gas.\n2. Before cleaning, repairing, or inspecting, make certain the blade and all moving parts have stopped. Disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine to prevent unintended starting.\n3. Check the blade and engine mounting bolts at frequent intervals for proper tightness. Also, visually inspect blade for damage (e.g., bent, cracked, worn). Replace blade with the original equipment manufacturer\u2019s (O.E.M.) blade only, listed in this manual. \u201cUse of parts which do not meet the original equipment specifications may lead to improper performance and compromise safety!\u201d\n4. Mower blades are sharp and can cut. Wrap the blade or wear gloves, and use extra caution when servicing them.\n5. Keep all nuts, bolts, and screws tight to be sure the equipment is in safe working condition.\n6. Never tamper with safety devices. Check their proper operation regularly.\n7. After striking a foreign object, stop the engine, disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine. Thoroughly inspect the mower for any damage. Repair the damage before starting and operating the mower.\n8. Never attempt to make adjustments or repairs to the mower while the engine is running.\n9. Grass catcher components are subject to wear, damage and deterioration, which could expose moving parts or allow objects to be thrown. Frequently check components and replace with the manufacturer\u2019s recommended parts when necessary.\n10. Mower blades are sharp and can cut.

            "### DANGER\n\nThis machine was built to be operated according to the safe operation practices in this manual. As with any type of power equipment, carelessness or error on the part of the operator can result in serious injury. This machine is capable of amputating fingers, hands, toes and feet and throwing objects. Failure to observe the following safety instructions could result in serious injury or death.\n\n### General Operation",
            "1. Read this operator's manual carefully in its entirety before attempting to assemble this machine. Read, understand, and follow all instructions on the machine and in the manual(s) before operation. Keep this manual in a safe place for future and regular reference and for ordering replacement parts.\n2. Be completely familiar with the controls and the proper use of this machine before operating it.\n3. This machine is a precision piece of power equipment, not a plaything. Therefore, exercise extreme caution at all times. This machine has been designed to perform one job: to mow grass. Do not use it for any other purpose.\n4. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and should be trained and supervised by an adult.\n5. Only responsible individuals who are familiar with these rules of safe operation should be allowed to use this machine.\n6. Thoroughly inspect the area where the equipment is to be used. Remove all stones, sticks, wire, bones, toys and other foreign objects, which could be tripped over or picked up and thrown by the blade. Thrown objects can cause serious personal injury.\n7. Plan your mowing pattern to avoid discharge of material toward roads, sidewalks, bystanders and the like. Also, avoid discharging material against a wall or obstruction, which may cause discharged material to ricochet back toward the operator.\n8. To help avoid blade contact or a thrown object injury, stay in operator zone behind handles and keep children, bystanders, helpers and pets at least 75 feet from mower while it is in operation. Stop machine if anyone enters area.\n9. Always wear safety glasses or safety goggles during operation and while performing an adjustment or repair to protect your eyes. Thrown objects which ricochet can cause serious injury to the eyes.\n10. Wear sturdy, rough-soled work shoes and close-fitting slacks and shirts. Shirts and pants that cover the arms and legs and steel-toed shoes are recommended. Never operate this machine in bare feet, sandals, slippery or lightweight (e.g., canvas) shoes.\n11. Do not put hands or feet near rotating parts or under the cutting deck. Contact with blade can amputate fingers, hands, toes and feet.\n12. A missing or damaged discharge cover can cause blade contact or thrown object injuries.\n13. Many injuries occur as a result of the mower being pulled over the foot during a fall caused by slipping or tripping. Do not hold onto the mower if you are falling; release the handle immediately.\n14. Never pull the mower back toward you while you are walking. If you must back the mower away from a wall or obstruction first look down and behind to avoid tripping and then follow these steps:\n    - Step back from mower to fully extend your arms.\n    - Be sure you are well balanced with sure footing.\n    - Pull the mower back slowly, no more than halfway toward you.\n    - Repeat these steps as needed.\n15. Do not operate the mower while under the influence of alcohol or drugs.\n16. Do not engage the self-propelled mechanism on machines so equipped while starting engine.\n17. The blade control is a safety device. Never attempt to bypass its operation. Doing so makes the safety device inoperative and may result in personal injury through contact with the rotating blade. The blade control must operate easily in both directions and automatically return to the disengaged position when released.\n18. Never operate the mower in wet grass. Always be sure of your footing. A slip and fall can cause serious personal injury. If you feel you are losing your footing, release the blade control handle immediately and the blade will stop rotating within three seconds.\n19. Mow only in daylight or good artificial light. Walk, never run.\n20. Stop the blade when crossing gravel drives, walks or roads.\n21. If the equipment should start to vibrate abnormally, stop the engine and check immediately for the cause. Vibration is generally a warning of trouble.\n22. Shut the engine off and wait until the blade comes to a complete stop before removing the grass catcher or unclogging the chute. The cutting blade continues to rotate for a few seconds after the blade control is released. Never place any part of the body in the blade area until you are sure the blade has stopped rotating.\n23. Never operate mower without proper trail shield, discharge cover, grass catcher, blade control or other safety protective devices in place and working. Never operate mower with damaged safety devices. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.\n24. Muffler and engine become hot and can cause a burn. Do not touch.\n25. Never attempt to make a wheel or cutting height adjustment while the engine is running.\n26. Only use parts and accessories made for this machine by the manufacturer. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.",
            "27. When starting engine, pull cord slowly until resistance is felt, then pull rapidly. Rapid retraction of starter cord (kickback) will pull hand and arm toward engine faster than you can let go. Broken bones, fractures, bruises or sprains could result.\n28. If situations occur which are not covered in this manual, use care and good judgment. Contact Customer Support for assistance and the name of your nearest servicing dealer.",
            "### Children\n\nTragic accidents can occur if the operator is not alert to the presence of children. Children are often attracted to the mower and the mowing activity. They do not understand the dangers. Never assume that children will remain where you last saw them.\n\n1. Keep children out of the mowing area and under watchful care of a responsible adult other than the operator.\n2. Be alert and turn mower off if a child enters the area.\n3. Before and while moving backwards, look behind and down for small children.\n4. Use extreme care when approaching blind corners, doorways, shrubs, trees, or other objects that may block your vision of a child who may run into the mower.\n5. Keep children away from hot or running engines. They can suffer burns from a hot muffler.\n6. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and be trained and supervised by an adult.\n\n### Service\n\nSafe Handling of Gasoline\n\nTo avoid personal injury or property damage, use extreme care in handling gasoline. Gasoline is extremely flammable and the vapors are explosive. Serious personal injury can occur when gasoline is spilled on yourself or your clothes, which can ignite. Wash your skin and change clothes immediately.\n\n1. Use only an approved gasoline container.\n2. Never fill containers inside a vehicle or on a truck or trailer bed with a plastic liner. Always place containers on the ground away from your vehicle before filling.\n3. Remove gas-powered equipment from the truck or trailer and refuel it on the ground. If this is not possible, then refuel such equipment on a trailer with a portable container, rather than from a gasoline dispenser nozzle.\n4. Keep the nozzle in contact with the rim of the fuel tank or container opening at all times until fueling is complete. Do not use a nozzle lock-open device.\n5. Extinguish all cigarettes, cigars, pipes and other sources of ignition.\n6. Never fuel machine indoors because flammable vapors will accumulate in the area.\n7. Never remove gas cap or add fuel while the engine is hot or running. Allow engine to cool at least two minutes before refueling.\n8. Never overfill fuel tank. Fill tank to no more than \u00bd inch below bottom of filler neck to provide space for fuel expansion.\n9. Replace gasoline cap and tighten securely.\n10. If gasoline is spilled, wipe it off the engine and equipment. Move machine to another area. Wait 5 minutes before starting engine.\n11. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light (e.g. furnace, water heater, space heater, clothes dryer, etc.).\n12. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n13. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light such as a water heater, furnace, clothes dryer etc.\n14. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n\n---\n\n## General Service\n\n1. Never run an engine indoors or in a poorly ventilated area. Engine exhaust contains carbon monoxide, an odorless and deadly gas.\n2. Before cleaning, repairing, or inspecting, make certain the blade and all moving parts have stopped. Disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine to prevent unintended starting.\n3. Check the blade and engine mounting bolts at frequent intervals for proper tightness. Also, visually inspect blade for damage (e.g., bent, cracked, worn). Replace blade with the original equipment manufacturer\u2019s (O.E.M.) blade only, listed in this manual. \u201cUse of parts which do not meet the original equipment specifications may lead to improper performance and compromise safety!\u201d\n4. Mower blades are sharp and can cut. Wrap the blade or wear gloves, and use extra caution when servicing them.\n5. Keep all nuts, bolts, and screws tight to be sure the equipment is in safe working condition.\n6. Never tamper with safety devices. Check their proper operation regularly.\n7. After striking a foreign object, stop the engine, disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine. Thoroughly inspect the mower for any damage. Repair the damage before starting and operating the mower.\n8. Never attempt to make adjustments or repairs to the mower while the engine is running.\n9. Grass catcher components are subject to wear, damage and deterioration, which could expose moving parts or allow objects to be thrown. Frequently check components and replace with the manufacturer\u2019s recommended parts when necessary.\n10. Mower blades are sharp and can cut.

            "### DANGER\n\nThis machine was built to be operated according to the safe operation practices in this manual. As with any type of power equipment, carelessness or error on the part of the operator can result in serious injury. This machine is capable of amputating fingers, hands, toes and feet and throwing objects. Failure to observe the following safety instructions could result in serious injury or death.\n\n### General Operation",
            "1. Read this operator's manual carefully in its entirety before attempting to assemble this machine. Read, understand, and follow all instructions on the machine and in the manual(s) before operation. Keep this manual in a safe place for future and regular reference and for ordering replacement parts.\n2. Be completely familiar with the controls and the proper use of this machine before operating it.\n3. This machine is a precision piece of power equipment, not a plaything. Therefore, exercise extreme caution at all times. This machine has been designed to perform one job: to mow grass. Do not use it for any other purpose.\n4. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and should be trained and supervised by an adult.\n5. Only responsible individuals who are familiar with these rules of safe operation should be allowed to use this machine.\n6. Thoroughly inspect the area where the equipment is to be used. Remove all stones, sticks, wire, bones, toys and other foreign objects, which could be tripped over or picked up and thrown by the blade. Thrown objects can cause serious personal injury.\n7. Plan your mowing pattern to avoid discharge of material toward roads, sidewalks, bystanders and the like. Also, avoid discharging material against a wall or obstruction, which may cause discharged material to ricochet back toward the operator.\n8. To help avoid blade contact or a thrown object injury, stay in operator zone behind handles and keep children, bystanders, helpers and pets at least 75 feet from mower while it is in operation. Stop machine if anyone enters area.\n9. Always wear safety glasses or safety goggles during operation and while performing an adjustment or repair to protect your eyes. Thrown objects which ricochet can cause serious injury to the eyes.\n10. Wear sturdy, rough-soled work shoes and close-fitting slacks and shirts. Shirts and pants that cover the arms and legs and steel-toed shoes are recommended. Never operate this machine in bare feet, sandals, slippery or lightweight (e.g., canvas) shoes.\n11. Do not put hands or feet near rotating parts or under the cutting deck. Contact with blade can amputate fingers, hands, toes and feet.\n12. A missing or damaged discharge cover can cause blade contact or thrown object injuries.\n13. Many injuries occur as a result of the mower being pulled over the foot during a fall caused by slipping or tripping. Do not hold onto the mower if you are falling; release the handle immediately.\n14. Never pull the mower back toward you while you are walking. If you must back the mower away from a wall or obstruction first look down and behind to avoid tripping and then follow these steps:\n    - Step back from mower to fully extend your arms.\n    - Be sure you are well balanced with sure footing.\n    - Pull the mower back slowly, no more than halfway toward you.\n    - Repeat these steps as needed.\n15. Do not operate the mower while under the influence of alcohol or drugs.\n16. Do not engage the self-propelled mechanism on machines so equipped while starting engine.\n17. The blade control is a safety device. Never attempt to bypass its operation. Doing so makes the safety device inoperative and may result in personal injury through contact with the rotating blade. The blade control must operate easily in both directions and automatically return to the disengaged position when released.\n18. Never operate the mower in wet grass. Always be sure of your footing. A slip and fall can cause serious personal injury. If you feel you are losing your footing, release the blade control handle immediately and the blade will stop rotating within three seconds.\n19. Mow only in daylight or good artificial light. Walk, never run.\n20. Stop the blade when crossing gravel drives, walks or roads.\n21. If the equipment should start to vibrate abnormally, stop the engine and check immediately for the cause. Vibration is generally a warning of trouble.\n22. Shut the engine off and wait until the blade comes to a complete stop before removing the grass catcher or unclogging the chute. The cutting blade continues to rotate for a few seconds after the blade control is released. Never place any part of the body in the blade area until you are sure the blade has stopped rotating.\n23. Never operate mower without proper trail shield, discharge cover, grass catcher, blade control or other safety protective devices in place and working. Never operate mower with damaged safety devices. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.\n24. Muffler and engine become hot and can cause a burn. Do not touch.\n25. Never attempt to make a wheel or cutting height adjustment while the engine is running.\n26. Only use parts and accessories made for this machine by the manufacturer. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.",
            "27. When starting engine, pull cord slowly until resistance is felt, then pull rapidly. Rapid retraction of starter cord (kickback) will pull hand and arm toward engine faster than you can let go. Broken bones, fractures, bruises or sprains could result.\n28. If situations occur which are not covered in this manual, use care and good judgment. Contact Customer Support for assistance and the name of your nearest servicing dealer.",
            "### Children\n\nTragic accidents can occur if the operator is not alert to the presence of children. Children are often attracted to the mower and the mowing activity. They do not understand the dangers. Never assume that children will remain where you last saw them.\n\n1. Keep children out of the mowing area and under watchful care of a responsible adult other than the operator.\n2. Be alert and turn mower off if a child enters the area.\n3. Before and while moving backwards, look behind and down for small children.\n4. Use extreme care when approaching blind corners, doorways, shrubs, trees, or other objects that may block your vision of a child who may run into the mower.\n5. Keep children away from hot or running engines. They can suffer burns from a hot muffler.\n6. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and be trained and supervised by an adult.\n\n### Service\n\nSafe Handling of Gasoline\n\nTo avoid personal injury or property damage, use extreme care in handling gasoline. Gasoline is extremely flammable and the vapors are explosive. Serious personal injury can occur when gasoline is spilled on yourself or your clothes, which can ignite. Wash your skin and change clothes immediately.\n\n1. Use only an approved gasoline container.\n2. Never fill containers inside a vehicle or on a truck or trailer bed with a plastic liner. Always place containers on the ground away from your vehicle before filling.\n3. Remove gas-powered equipment from the truck or trailer and refuel it on the ground. If this is not possible, then refuel such equipment on a trailer with a portable container, rather than from a gasoline dispenser nozzle.\n4. Keep the nozzle in contact with the rim of the fuel tank or container opening at all times until fueling is complete. Do not use a nozzle lock-open device.\n5. Extinguish all cigarettes, cigars, pipes and other sources of ignition.\n6. Never fuel machine indoors because flammable vapors will accumulate in the area.\n7. Never remove gas cap or add fuel while the engine is hot or running. Allow engine to cool at least two minutes before refueling.\n8. Never overfill fuel tank. Fill tank to no more than \u00bd inch below bottom of filler neck to provide space for fuel expansion.\n9. Replace gasoline cap and tighten securely.\n10. If gasoline is spilled, wipe it off the engine and equipment. Move machine to another area. Wait 5 minutes before starting engine.\n11. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light (e.g. furnace, water heater, space heater, clothes dryer, etc.).\n12. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n13. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light such as a water heater, furnace, clothes dryer etc.\n14. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n\n---\n\n## General Service\n\n1. Never run an engine indoors or in a poorly ventilated area. Engine exhaust contains carbon monoxide, an odorless and deadly gas.\n2. Before cleaning, repairing, or inspecting, make certain the blade and all moving parts have stopped. Disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine to prevent unintended starting.\n3. Check the blade and engine mounting bolts at frequent intervals for proper tightness. Also, visually inspect blade for damage (e.g., bent, cracked, worn). Replace blade with the original equipment manufacturer\u2019s (O.E.M.) blade only, listed in this manual. \u201cUse of parts which do not meet the original equipment specifications may lead to improper performance and compromise safety!\u201d\n4. Mower blades are sharp and can cut. Wrap the blade or wear gloves, and use extra caution when servicing them.\n5. Keep all nuts, bolts, and screws tight to be sure the equipment is in safe working condition.\n6. Never tamper with safety devices. Check their proper operation regularly.\n7. After striking a foreign object, stop the engine, disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine. Thoroughly inspect the mower for any damage. Repair the damage before starting and operating the mower.\n8. Never attempt to make adjustments or repairs to the mower while the engine is running.\n9. Grass catcher components are subject to wear, damage and deterioration, which could expose moving parts or allow objects to be thrown. Frequently check components and replace with the manufacturer\u2019s recommended parts when necessary.\n10. Mower blades are sharp and can cut.

            "### DANGER\n\nThis machine was built to be operated according to the safe operation practices in this manual. As with any type of power equipment, carelessness or error on the part of the operator can result in serious injury. This machine is capable of amputating fingers, hands, toes and feet and throwing objects. Failure to observe the following safety instructions could result in serious injury or death.\n\n### General Operation",
            "1. Read this operator's manual carefully in its entirety before attempting to assemble this machine. Read, understand, and follow all instructions on the machine and in the manual(s) before operation. Keep this manual in a safe place for future and regular reference and for ordering replacement parts.\n2. Be completely familiar with the controls and the proper use of this machine before operating it.\n3. This machine is a precision piece of power equipment, not a plaything. Therefore, exercise extreme caution at all times. This machine has been designed to perform one job: to mow grass. Do not use it for any other purpose.\n4. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and should be trained and supervised by an adult.\n5. Only responsible individuals who are familiar with these rules of safe operation should be allowed to use this machine.\n6. Thoroughly inspect the area where the equipment is to be used. Remove all stones, sticks, wire, bones, toys and other foreign objects, which could be tripped over or picked up and thrown by the blade. Thrown objects can cause serious personal injury.\n7. Plan your mowing pattern to avoid discharge of material toward roads, sidewalks, bystanders and the like. Also, avoid discharging material against a wall or obstruction, which may cause discharged material to ricochet back toward the operator.\n8. To help avoid blade contact or a thrown object injury, stay in operator zone behind handles and keep children, bystanders, helpers and pets at least 75 feet from mower while it is in operation. Stop machine if anyone enters area.\n9. Always wear safety glasses or safety goggles during operation and while performing an adjustment or repair to protect your eyes. Thrown objects which ricochet can cause serious injury to the eyes.\n10. Wear sturdy, rough-soled work shoes and close-fitting slacks and shirts. Shirts and pants that cover the arms and legs and steel-toed shoes are recommended. Never operate this machine in bare feet, sandals, slippery or lightweight (e.g., canvas) shoes.\n11. Do not put hands or feet near rotating parts or under the cutting deck. Contact with blade can amputate fingers, hands, toes and feet.\n12. A missing or damaged discharge cover can cause blade contact or thrown object injuries.\n13. Many injuries occur as a result of the mower being pulled over the foot during a fall caused by slipping or tripping. Do not hold onto the mower if you are falling; release the handle immediately.\n14. Never pull the mower back toward you while you are walking. If you must back the mower away from a wall or obstruction first look down and behind to avoid tripping and then follow these steps:\n    - Step back from mower to fully extend your arms.\n    - Be sure you are well balanced with sure footing.\n    - Pull the mower back slowly, no more than halfway toward you.\n    - Repeat these steps as needed.\n15. Do not operate the mower while under the influence of alcohol or drugs.\n16. Do not engage the self-propelled mechanism on machines so equipped while starting engine.\n17. The blade control is a safety device. Never attempt to bypass its operation. Doing so makes the safety device inoperative and may result in personal injury through contact with the rotating blade. The blade control must operate easily in both directions and automatically return to the disengaged position when released.\n18. Never operate the mower in wet grass. Always be sure of your footing. A slip and fall can cause serious personal injury. If you feel you are losing your footing, release the blade control handle immediately and the blade will stop rotating within three seconds.\n19. Mow only in daylight or good artificial light. Walk, never run.\n20. Stop the blade when crossing gravel drives, walks or roads.\n21. If the equipment should start to vibrate abnormally, stop the engine and check immediately for the cause. Vibration is generally a warning of trouble.\n22. Shut the engine off and wait until the blade comes to a complete stop before removing the grass catcher or unclogging the chute. The cutting blade continues to rotate for a few seconds after the blade control is released. Never place any part of the body in the blade area until you are sure the blade has stopped rotating.\n23. Never operate mower without proper trail shield, discharge cover, grass catcher, blade control or other safety protective devices in place and working. Never operate mower with damaged safety devices. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.\n24. Muffler and engine become hot and can cause a burn. Do not touch.\n25. Never attempt to make a wheel or cutting height adjustment while the engine is running.\n26. Only use parts and accessories made for this machine by the manufacturer. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.",
            "27. When starting engine, pull cord slowly until resistance is felt, then pull rapidly. Rapid retraction of starter cord (kickback) will pull hand and arm toward engine faster than you can let go. Broken bones, fractures, bruises or sprains could result.\n28. If situations occur which are not covered in this manual, use care and good judgment. Contact Customer Support for assistance and the name of your nearest servicing dealer.",
            "### Children\n\nTragic accidents can occur if the operator is not alert to the presence of children. Children are often attracted to the mower and the mowing activity. They do not understand the dangers. Never assume that children will remain where you last saw them.\n\n1. Keep children out of the mowing area and under watchful care of a responsible adult other than the operator.\n2. Be alert and turn mower off if a child enters the area.\n3. Before and while moving backwards, look behind and down for small children.\n4. Use extreme care when approaching blind corners, doorways, shrubs, trees, or other objects that may block your vision of a child who may run into the mower.\n5. Keep children away from hot or running engines. They can suffer burns from a hot muffler.\n6. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and be trained and supervised by an adult.\n\n### Service\n\nSafe Handling of Gasoline\n\nTo avoid personal injury or property damage, use extreme care in handling gasoline. Gasoline is extremely flammable and the vapors are explosive. Serious personal injury can occur when gasoline is spilled on yourself or your clothes, which can ignite. Wash your skin and change clothes immediately.\n\n1. Use only an approved gasoline container.\n2. Never fill containers inside a vehicle or on a truck or trailer bed with a plastic liner. Always place containers on the ground away from your vehicle before filling.\n3. Remove gas-powered equipment from the truck or trailer and refuel it on the ground. If this is not possible, then refuel such equipment on a trailer with a portable container, rather than from a gasoline dispenser nozzle.\n4. Keep the nozzle in contact with the rim of the fuel tank or container opening at all times until fueling is complete. Do not use a nozzle lock-open device.\n5. Extinguish all cigarettes, cigars, pipes and other sources of ignition.\n6. Never fuel machine indoors because flammable vapors will accumulate in the area.\n7. Never remove gas cap or add fuel while the engine is hot or running. Allow engine to cool at least two minutes before refueling.\n8. Never overfill fuel tank. Fill tank to no more than \u00bd inch below bottom of filler neck to provide space for fuel expansion.\n9. Replace gasoline cap and tighten securely.\n10. If gasoline is spilled, wipe it off the engine and equipment. Move machine to another area. Wait 5 minutes before starting engine.\n11. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light (e.g. furnace, water heater, space heater, clothes dryer, etc.).\n12. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n13. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light such as a water heater, furnace, clothes dryer etc.\n14. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n\n---\n\n## General Service\n\n1. Never run an engine indoors or in a poorly ventilated area. Engine exhaust contains carbon monoxide, an odorless and deadly gas.\n2. Before cleaning, repairing, or inspecting, make certain the blade and all moving parts have stopped. Disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine to prevent unintended starting.\n3. Check the blade and engine mounting bolts at frequent intervals for proper tightness. Also, visually inspect blade for damage (e.g., bent, cracked, worn). Replace blade with the original equipment manufacturer\u2019s (O.E.M.) blade only, listed in this manual. \u201cUse of parts which do not meet the original equipment specifications may lead to improper performance and compromise safety!\u201d\n4. Mower blades are sharp and can cut. Wrap the blade or wear gloves, and use extra caution when servicing them.\n5. Keep all nuts, bolts, and screws tight to be sure the equipment is in safe working condition.\n6. Never tamper with safety devices. Check their proper operation regularly.\n7. After striking a foreign object, stop the engine, disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine. Thoroughly inspect the mower for any damage. Repair the damage before starting and operating the mower.\n8. Never attempt to make adjustments or repairs to the mower while the engine is running.\n9. Grass catcher components are subject to wear, damage and deterioration, which could expose moving parts or allow objects to be thrown. Frequently check components and replace with the manufacturer\u2019s recommended parts when necessary.\n10. Mower blades are sharp and can cut.

            "### DANGER\n\nThis machine was built to be operated according to the safe operation practices in this manual. As with any type of power equipment, carelessness or error on the part of the operator can result in serious injury. This machine is capable of amputating fingers, hands, toes and feet and throwing objects. Failure to observe the following safety instructions could result in serious injury or death.\n\n### General Operation",
            "1. Read this operator's manual carefully in its entirety before attempting to assemble this machine. Read, understand, and follow all instructions on the machine and in the manual(s) before operation. Keep this manual in a safe place for future and regular reference and for ordering replacement parts.\n2. Be completely familiar with the controls and the proper use of this machine before operating it.\n3. This machine is a precision piece of power equipment, not a plaything. Therefore, exercise extreme caution at all times. This machine has been designed to perform one job: to mow grass. Do not use it for any other purpose.\n4. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and should be trained and supervised by an adult.\n5. Only responsible individuals who are familiar with these rules of safe operation should be allowed to use this machine.\n6. Thoroughly inspect the area where the equipment is to be used. Remove all stones, sticks, wire, bones, toys and other foreign objects, which could be tripped over or picked up and thrown by the blade. Thrown objects can cause serious personal injury.\n7. Plan your mowing pattern to avoid discharge of material toward roads, sidewalks, bystanders and the like. Also, avoid discharging material against a wall or obstruction, which may cause discharged material to ricochet back toward the operator.\n8. To help avoid blade contact or a thrown object injury, stay in operator zone behind handles and keep children, bystanders, helpers and pets at least 75 feet from mower while it is in operation. Stop machine if anyone enters area.\n9. Always wear safety glasses or safety goggles during operation and while performing an adjustment or repair to protect your eyes. Thrown objects which ricochet can cause serious injury to the eyes.\n10. Wear sturdy, rough-soled work shoes and close-fitting slacks and shirts. Shirts and pants that cover the arms and legs and steel-toed shoes are recommended. Never operate this machine in bare feet, sandals, slippery or lightweight (e.g., canvas) shoes.\n11. Do not put hands or feet near rotating parts or under the cutting deck. Contact with blade can amputate fingers, hands, toes and feet.\n12. A missing or damaged discharge cover can cause blade contact or thrown object injuries.\n13. Many injuries occur as a result of the mower being pulled over the foot during a fall caused by slipping or tripping. Do not hold onto the mower if you are falling; release the handle immediately.\n14. Never pull the mower back toward you while you are walking. If you must back the mower away from a wall or obstruction first look down and behind to avoid tripping and then follow these steps:\n    - Step back from mower to fully extend your arms.\n    - Be sure you are well balanced with sure footing.\n    - Pull the mower back slowly, no more than halfway toward you.\n    - Repeat these steps as needed.\n15. Do not operate the mower while under the influence of alcohol or drugs.\n16. Do not engage the self-propelled mechanism on machines so equipped while starting engine.\n17. The blade control is a safety device. Never attempt to bypass its operation. Doing so makes the safety device inoperative and may result in personal injury through contact with the rotating blade. The blade control must operate easily in both directions and automatically return to the disengaged position when released.\n18. Never operate the mower in wet grass. Always be sure of your footing. A slip and fall can cause serious personal injury. If you feel you are losing your footing, release the blade control handle immediately and the blade will stop rotating within three seconds.\n19. Mow only in daylight or good artificial light. Walk, never run.\n20. Stop the blade when crossing gravel drives, walks or roads.\n21. If the equipment should start to vibrate abnormally, stop the engine and check immediately for the cause. Vibration is generally a warning of trouble.\n22. Shut the engine off and wait until the blade comes to a complete stop before removing the grass catcher or unclogging the chute. The cutting blade continues to rotate for a few seconds after the blade control is released. Never place any part of the body in the blade area until you are sure the blade has stopped rotating.\n23. Never operate mower without proper trail shield, discharge cover, grass catcher, blade control or other safety protective devices in place and working. Never operate mower with damaged safety devices. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.\n24. Muffler and engine become hot and can cause a burn. Do not touch.\n25. Never attempt to make a wheel or cutting height adjustment while the engine is running.\n26. Only use parts and accessories made for this machine by the manufacturer. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.",
            "27. When starting engine, pull cord slowly until resistance is felt, then pull rapidly. Rapid retraction of starter cord (kickback) will pull hand and arm toward engine faster than you can let go. Broken bones, fractures, bruises or sprains could result.\n28. If situations occur which are not covered in this manual, use care and good judgment. Contact Customer Support for assistance and the name of your nearest servicing dealer.",
            "### Children\n\nTragic accidents can occur if the operator is not alert to the presence of children. Children are often attracted to the mower and the mowing activity. They do not understand the dangers. Never assume that children will remain where you last saw them.\n\n1. Keep children out of the mowing area and under watchful care of a responsible adult other than the operator.\n2. Be alert and turn mower off if a child enters the area.\n3. Before and while moving backwards, look behind and down for small children.\n4. Use extreme care when approaching blind corners, doorways, shrubs, trees, or other objects that may block your vision of a child who may run into the mower.\n5. Keep children away from hot or running engines. They can suffer burns from a hot muffler.\n6. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and be trained and supervised by an adult.\n\n### Service\n\nSafe Handling of Gasoline\n\nTo avoid personal injury or property damage, use extreme care in handling gasoline. Gasoline is extremely flammable and the vapors are explosive. Serious personal injury can occur when gasoline is spilled on yourself or your clothes, which can ignite. Wash your skin and change clothes immediately.\n\n1. Use only an approved gasoline container.\n2. Never fill containers inside a vehicle or on a truck or trailer bed with a plastic liner. Always place containers on the ground away from your vehicle before filling.\n3. Remove gas-powered equipment from the truck or trailer and refuel it on the ground. If this is not possible, then refuel such equipment on a trailer with a portable container, rather than from a gasoline dispenser nozzle.\n4. Keep the nozzle in contact with the rim of the fuel tank or container opening at all times until fueling is complete. Do not use a nozzle lock-open device.\n5. Extinguish all cigarettes, cigars, pipes and other sources of ignition.\n6. Never fuel machine indoors because flammable vapors will accumulate in the area.\n7. Never remove gas cap or add fuel while the engine is hot or running. Allow engine to cool at least two minutes before refueling.\n8. Never overfill fuel tank. Fill tank to no more than \u00bd inch below bottom of filler neck to provide space for fuel expansion.\n9. Replace gasoline cap and tighten securely.\n10. If gasoline is spilled, wipe it off the engine and equipment. Move machine to another area. Wait 5 minutes before starting engine.\n11. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light (e.g. furnace, water heater, space heater, clothes dryer, etc.).\n12. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n13. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light such as a water heater, furnace, clothes dryer etc.\n14. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n\n---\n\n## General Service\n\n1. Never run an engine indoors or in a poorly ventilated area. Engine exhaust contains carbon monoxide, an odorless and deadly gas.\n2. Before cleaning, repairing, or inspecting, make certain the blade and all moving parts have stopped. Disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine to prevent unintended starting.\n3. Check the blade and engine mounting bolts at frequent intervals for proper tightness. Also, visually inspect blade for damage (e.g., bent, cracked, worn). Replace blade with the original equipment manufacturer\u2019s (O.E.M.) blade only, listed in this manual. \u201cUse of parts which do not meet the original equipment specifications may lead to improper performance and compromise safety!\u201d\n4. Mower blades are sharp and can cut. Wrap the blade or wear gloves, and use extra caution when servicing them.\n5. Keep all nuts, bolts, and screws tight to be sure the equipment is in safe working condition.\n6. Never tamper with safety devices. Check their proper operation regularly.\n7. After striking a foreign object, stop the engine, disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine. Thoroughly inspect the mower for any damage. Repair the damage before starting and operating the mower.\n8. Never attempt to make adjustments or repairs to the mower while the engine is running.\n9. Grass catcher components are subject to wear, damage and deterioration, which could expose moving parts or allow objects to be thrown. Frequently check components and replace with the manufacturer\u2019s recommended parts when necessary.\n10. Mower blades are sharp and can cut.

            "### DANGER\n\nThis machine was built to be operated according to the safe operation practices in this manual. As with any type of power equipment, carelessness or error on the part of the operator can result in serious injury. This machine is capable of amputating fingers, hands, toes and feet and throwing objects. Failure to observe the following safety instructions could result in serious injury or death.\n\n### General Operation",
            "1. Read this operator's manual carefully in its entirety before attempting to assemble this machine. Read, understand, and follow all instructions on the machine and in the manual(s) before operation. Keep this manual in a safe place for future and regular reference and for ordering replacement parts.\n2. Be completely familiar with the controls and the proper use of this machine before operating it.\n3. This machine is a precision piece of power equipment, not a plaything. Therefore, exercise extreme caution at all times. This machine has been designed to perform one job: to mow grass. Do not use it for any other purpose.\n4. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and should be trained and supervised by an adult.\n5. Only responsible individuals who are familiar with these rules of safe operation should be allowed to use this machine.\n6. Thoroughly inspect the area where the equipment is to be used. Remove all stones, sticks, wire, bones, toys and other foreign objects, which could be tripped over or picked up and thrown by the blade. Thrown objects can cause serious personal injury.\n7. Plan your mowing pattern to avoid discharge of material toward roads, sidewalks, bystanders and the like. Also, avoid discharging material against a wall or obstruction, which may cause discharged material to ricochet back toward the operator.\n8. To help avoid blade contact or a thrown object injury, stay in operator zone behind handles and keep children, bystanders, helpers and pets at least 75 feet from mower while it is in operation. Stop machine if anyone enters area.\n9. Always wear safety glasses or safety goggles during operation and while performing an adjustment or repair to protect your eyes. Thrown objects which ricochet can cause serious injury to the eyes.\n10. Wear sturdy, rough-soled work shoes and close-fitting slacks and shirts. Shirts and pants that cover the arms and legs and steel-toed shoes are recommended. Never operate this machine in bare feet, sandals, slippery or lightweight (e.g., canvas) shoes.\n11. Do not put hands or feet near rotating parts or under the cutting deck. Contact with blade can amputate fingers, hands, toes and feet.\n12. A missing or damaged discharge cover can cause blade contact or thrown object injuries.\n13. Many injuries occur as a result of the mower being pulled over the foot during a fall caused by slipping or tripping. Do not hold onto the mower if you are falling; release the handle immediately.\n14. Never pull the mower back toward you while you are walking. If you must back the mower away from a wall or obstruction first look down and behind to avoid tripping and then follow these steps:\n    - Step back from mower to fully extend your arms.\n    - Be sure you are well balanced with sure footing.\n    - Pull the mower back slowly, no more than halfway toward you.\n    - Repeat these steps as needed.\n15. Do not operate the mower while under the influence of alcohol or drugs.\n16. Do not engage the self-propelled mechanism on machines so equipped while starting engine.\n17. The blade control is a safety device. Never attempt to bypass its operation. Doing so makes the safety device inoperative and may result in personal injury through contact with the rotating blade. The blade control must operate easily in both directions and automatically return to the disengaged position when released.\n18. Never operate the mower in wet grass. Always be sure of your footing. A slip and fall can cause serious personal injury. If you feel you are losing your footing, release the blade control handle immediately and the blade will stop rotating within three seconds.\n19. Mow only in daylight or good artificial light. Walk, never run.\n20. Stop the blade when crossing gravel drives, walks or roads.\n21. If the equipment should start to vibrate abnormally, stop the engine and check immediately for the cause. Vibration is generally a warning of trouble.\n22. Shut the engine off and wait until the blade comes to a complete stop before removing the grass catcher or unclogging the chute. The cutting blade continues to rotate for a few seconds after the blade control is released. Never place any part of the body in the blade area until you are sure the blade has stopped rotating.\n23. Never operate mower without proper trail shield, discharge cover, grass catcher, blade control or other safety protective devices in place and working. Never operate mower with damaged safety devices. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.\n24. Muffler and engine become hot and can cause a burn. Do not touch.\n25. Never attempt to make a wheel or cutting height adjustment while the engine is running.\n26. Only use parts and accessories made for this machine by the manufacturer. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.",
            "27. When starting engine, pull cord slowly until resistance is felt, then pull rapidly. Rapid retraction of starter cord (kickback) will pull hand and arm toward engine faster than you can let go. Broken bones, fractures, bruises or sprains could result.\n28. If situations occur which are not covered in this manual, use care and good judgment. Contact Customer Support for assistance and the name of your nearest servicing dealer.",
            "### Children\n\nTragic accidents can occur if the operator is not alert to the presence of children. Children are often attracted to the mower and the mowing activity. They do not understand the dangers. Never assume that children will remain where you last saw them.\n\n1. Keep children out of the mowing area and under watchful care of a responsible adult other than the operator.\n2. Be alert and turn mower off if a child enters the area.\n3. Before and while moving backwards, look behind and down for small children.\n4. Use extreme care when approaching blind corners, doorways, shrubs, trees, or other objects that may block your vision of a child who may run into the mower.\n5. Keep children away from hot or running engines. They can suffer burns from a hot muffler.\n6. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and be trained and supervised by an adult.\n\n### Service\n\nSafe Handling of Gasoline\n\nTo avoid personal injury or property damage, use extreme care in handling gasoline. Gasoline is extremely flammable and the vapors are explosive. Serious personal injury can occur when gasoline is spilled on yourself or your clothes, which can ignite. Wash your skin and change clothes immediately.\n\n1. Use only an approved gasoline container.\n2. Never fill containers inside a vehicle or on a truck or trailer bed with a plastic liner. Always place containers on the ground away from your vehicle before filling.\n3. Remove gas-powered equipment from the truck or trailer and refuel it on the ground. If this is not possible, then refuel such equipment on a trailer with a portable container, rather than from a gasoline dispenser nozzle.\n4. Keep the nozzle in contact with the rim of the fuel tank or container opening at all times until fueling is complete. Do not use a nozzle lock-open device.\n5. Extinguish all cigarettes, cigars, pipes and other sources of ignition.\n6. Never fuel machine indoors because flammable vapors will accumulate in the area.\n7. Never remove gas cap or add fuel while the engine is hot or running. Allow engine to cool at least two minutes before refueling.\n8. Never overfill fuel tank. Fill tank to no more than \u00bd inch below bottom of filler neck to provide space for fuel expansion.\n9. Replace gasoline cap and tighten securely.\n10. If gasoline is spilled, wipe it off the engine and equipment. Move machine to another area. Wait 5 minutes before starting engine.\n11. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light (e.g. furnace, water heater, space heater, clothes dryer, etc.).\n12. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n13. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light such as a water heater, furnace, clothes dryer etc.\n14. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n\n---\n\n## General Service\n\n1. Never run an engine indoors or in a poorly ventilated area. Engine exhaust contains carbon monoxide, an odorless and deadly gas.\n2. Before cleaning, repairing, or inspecting, make certain the blade and all moving parts have stopped. Disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine to prevent unintended starting.\n3. Check the blade and engine mounting bolts at frequent intervals for proper tightness. Also, visually inspect blade for damage (e.g., bent, cracked, worn). Replace blade with the original equipment manufacturer\u2019s (O.E.M.) blade only, listed in this manual. \u201cUse of parts which do not meet the original equipment specifications may lead to improper performance and compromise safety!\u201d\n4. Mower blades are sharp and can cut. Wrap the blade or wear gloves, and use extra caution when servicing them.\n5. Keep all nuts, bolts, and screws tight to be sure the equipment is in safe working condition.\n6. Never tamper with safety devices. Check their proper operation regularly.\n7. After striking a foreign object, stop the engine, disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine. Thoroughly inspect the mower for any damage. Repair the damage before starting and operating the mower.\n8. Never attempt to make adjustments or repairs to the mower while the engine is running.\n9. Grass catcher components are subject to wear, damage and deterioration, which could expose moving parts or allow objects to be thrown. Frequently check components and replace with the manufacturer\u2019s recommended parts when necessary.\n10. Mower blades are sharp and can cut.

            "### DANGER\n\nThis machine was built to be operated according to the safe operation practices in this manual. As with any type of power equipment, carelessness or error on the part of the operator can result in serious injury. This machine is capable of amputating fingers, hands, toes and feet and throwing objects. Failure to observe the following safety instructions could result in serious injury or death.\n\n### General Operation",
            "1. Read this operator's manual carefully in its entirety before attempting to assemble this machine. Read, understand, and follow all instructions on the machine and in the manual(s) before operation. Keep this manual in a safe place for future and regular reference and for ordering replacement parts.\n2. Be completely familiar with the controls and the proper use of this machine before operating it.\n3. This machine is a precision piece of power equipment, not a plaything. Therefore, exercise extreme caution at all times. This machine has been designed to perform one job: to mow grass. Do not use it for any other purpose.\n4. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and should be trained and supervised by an adult.\n5. Only responsible individuals who are familiar with these rules of safe operation should be allowed to use this machine.\n6. Thoroughly inspect the area where the equipment is to be used. Remove all stones, sticks, wire, bones, toys and other foreign objects, which could be tripped over or picked up and thrown by the blade. Thrown objects can cause serious personal injury.\n7. Plan your mowing pattern to avoid discharge of material toward roads, sidewalks, bystanders and the like. Also, avoid discharging material against a wall or obstruction, which may cause discharged material to ricochet back toward the operator.\n8. To help avoid blade contact or a thrown object injury, stay in operator zone behind handles and keep children, bystanders, helpers and pets at least 75 feet from mower while it is in operation. Stop machine if anyone enters area.\n9. Always wear safety glasses or safety goggles during operation and while performing an adjustment or repair to protect your eyes. Thrown objects which ricochet can cause serious injury to the eyes.\n10. Wear sturdy, rough-soled work shoes and close-fitting slacks and shirts. Shirts and pants that cover the arms and legs and steel-toed shoes are recommended. Never operate this machine in bare feet, sandals, slippery or lightweight (e.g., canvas) shoes.\n11. Do not put hands or feet near rotating parts or under the cutting deck. Contact with blade can amputate fingers, hands, toes and feet.\n12. A missing or damaged discharge cover can cause blade contact or thrown object injuries.\n13. Many injuries occur as a result of the mower being pulled over the foot during a fall caused by slipping or tripping. Do not hold onto the mower if you are falling; release the handle immediately.\n14. Never pull the mower back toward you while you are walking. If you must back the mower away from a wall or obstruction first look down and behind to avoid tripping and then follow these steps:\n    - Step back from mower to fully extend your arms.\n    - Be sure you are well balanced with sure footing.\n    - Pull the mower back slowly, no more than halfway toward you.\n    - Repeat these steps as needed.\n15. Do not operate the mower while under the influence of alcohol or drugs.\n16. Do not engage the self-propelled mechanism on machines so equipped while starting engine.\n17. The blade control is a safety device. Never attempt to bypass its operation. Doing so makes the safety device inoperative and may result in personal injury through contact with the rotating blade. The blade control must operate easily in both directions and automatically return to the disengaged position when released.\n18. Never operate the mower in wet grass. Always be sure of your footing. A slip and fall can cause serious personal injury. If you feel you are losing your footing, release the blade control handle immediately and the blade will stop rotating within three seconds.\n19. Mow only in daylight or good artificial light. Walk, never run.\n20. Stop the blade when crossing gravel drives, walks or roads.\n21. If the equipment should start to vibrate abnormally, stop the engine and check immediately for the cause. Vibration is generally a warning of trouble.\n22. Shut the engine off and wait until the blade comes to a complete stop before removing the grass catcher or unclogging the chute. The cutting blade continues to rotate for a few seconds after the blade control is released. Never place any part of the body in the blade area until you are sure the blade has stopped rotating.\n23. Never operate mower without proper trail shield, discharge cover, grass catcher, blade control or other safety protective devices in place and working. Never operate mower with damaged safety devices. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.\n24. Muffler and engine become hot and can cause a burn. Do not touch.\n25. Never attempt to make a wheel or cutting height adjustment while the engine is running.\n26. Only use parts and accessories made for this machine by the manufacturer. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.",
            "27. When starting engine, pull cord slowly until resistance is felt, then pull rapidly. Rapid retraction of starter cord (kickback) will pull hand and arm toward engine faster than you can let go. Broken bones, fractures, bruises or sprains could result.\n28. If situations occur which are not covered in this manual, use care and good judgment. Contact Customer Support for assistance and the name of your nearest servicing dealer.",
            "### Children\n\nTragic accidents can occur if the operator is not alert to the presence of children. Children are often attracted to the mower and the mowing activity. They do not understand the dangers. Never assume that children will remain where you last saw them.\n\n1. Keep children out of the mowing area and under watchful care of a responsible adult other than the operator.\n2. Be alert and turn mower off if a child enters the area.\n3. Before and while moving backwards, look behind and down for small children.\n4. Use extreme care when approaching blind corners, doorways, shrubs, trees, or other objects that may block your vision of a child who may run into the mower.\n5. Keep children away from hot or running engines. They can suffer burns from a hot muffler.\n6. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and be trained and supervised by an adult.\n\n### Service\n\nSafe Handling of Gasoline\n\nTo avoid personal injury or property damage, use extreme care in handling gasoline. Gasoline is extremely flammable and the vapors are explosive. Serious personal injury can occur when gasoline is spilled on yourself or your clothes, which can ignite. Wash your skin and change clothes immediately.\n\n1. Use only an approved gasoline container.\n2. Never fill containers inside a vehicle or on a truck or trailer bed with a plastic liner. Always place containers on the ground away from your vehicle before filling.\n3. Remove gas-powered equipment from the truck or trailer and refuel it on the ground. If this is not possible, then refuel such equipment on a trailer with a portable container, rather than from a gasoline dispenser nozzle.\n4. Keep the nozzle in contact with the rim of the fuel tank or container opening at all times until fueling is complete. Do not use a nozzle lock-open device.\n5. Extinguish all cigarettes, cigars, pipes and other sources of ignition.\n6. Never fuel machine indoors because flammable vapors will accumulate in the area.\n7. Never remove gas cap or add fuel while the engine is hot or running. Allow engine to cool at least two minutes before refueling.\n8. Never overfill fuel tank. Fill tank to no more than \u00bd inch below bottom of filler neck to provide space for fuel expansion.\n9. Replace gasoline cap and tighten securely.\n10. If gasoline is spilled, wipe it off the engine and equipment. Move machine to another area. Wait 5 minutes before starting engine.\n11. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light (e.g. furnace, water heater, space heater, clothes dryer, etc.).\n12. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n13. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light such as a water heater, furnace, clothes dryer etc.\n14. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n\n---\n\n## General Service\n\n1. Never run an engine indoors or in a poorly ventilated area. Engine exhaust contains carbon monoxide, an odorless and deadly gas.\n2. Before cleaning, repairing, or inspecting, make certain the blade and all moving parts have stopped. Disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine to prevent unintended starting.\n3. Check the blade and engine mounting bolts at frequent intervals for proper tightness. Also, visually inspect blade for damage (e.g., bent, cracked, worn). Replace blade with the original equipment manufacturer\u2019s (O.E.M.) blade only, listed in this manual. \u201cUse of parts which do not meet the original equipment specifications may lead to improper performance and compromise safety!\u201d\n4. Mower blades are sharp and can cut. Wrap the blade or wear gloves, and use extra caution when servicing them.\n5. Keep all nuts, bolts, and screws tight to be sure the equipment is in safe working condition.\n6. Never tamper with safety devices. Check their proper operation regularly.\n7. After striking a foreign object, stop the engine, disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine. Thoroughly inspect the mower for any damage. Repair the damage before starting and operating the mower.\n8. Never attempt to make adjustments or repairs to the mower while the engine is running.\n9. Grass catcher components are subject to wear, damage and deterioration, which could expose moving parts or allow objects to be thrown. Frequently check components and replace with the manufacturer\u2019s recommended parts when necessary.\n10. Mower blades are sharp and can cut. Wrap the blade or wear gloves, and use extra caution when servicing them.\n11. Do not change the engine governor setting or over-speed the engine.

            "### DANGER\n\nThis machine was built to be operated according to the safe operation practices in this manual. As with any type of power equipment, carelessness or error on the part of the operator can result in serious injury. This machine is capable of amputating fingers, hands, toes and feet and throwing objects. Failure to observe the following safety instructions could result in serious injury or death.\n\n### General Operation",
            "1. Read this operator's manual carefully in its entirety before attempting to assemble this machine. Read, understand, and follow all instructions on the machine and in the manual(s) before operation. Keep this manual in a safe place for future and regular reference and for ordering replacement parts.\n2. Be completely familiar with the controls and the proper use of this machine before operating it.\n3. This machine is a precision piece of power equipment, not a plaything. Therefore, exercise extreme caution at all times. This machine has been designed to perform one job: to mow grass. Do not use it for any other purpose.\n4. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and should be trained and supervised by an adult.\n5. Only responsible individuals who are familiar with these rules of safe operation should be allowed to use this machine.\n6. Thoroughly inspect the area where the equipment is to be used. Remove all stones, sticks, wire, bones, toys and other foreign objects, which could be tripped over or picked up and thrown by the blade. Thrown objects can cause serious personal injury.\n7. Plan your mowing pattern to avoid discharge of material toward roads, sidewalks, bystanders and the like. Also, avoid discharging material against a wall or obstruction, which may cause discharged material to ricochet back toward the operator.\n8. To help avoid blade contact or a thrown object injury, stay in operator zone behind handles and keep children, bystanders, helpers and pets at least 75 feet from mower while it is in operation. Stop machine if anyone enters area.\n9. Always wear safety glasses or safety goggles during operation and while performing an adjustment or repair to protect your eyes. Thrown objects which ricochet can cause serious injury to the eyes.\n10. Wear sturdy, rough-soled work shoes and close-fitting slacks and shirts. Shirts and pants that cover the arms and legs and steel-toed shoes are recommended. Never operate this machine in bare feet, sandals, slippery or lightweight (e.g., canvas) shoes.\n11. Do not put hands or feet near rotating parts or under the cutting deck. Contact with blade can amputate fingers, hands, toes and feet.\n12. A missing or damaged discharge cover can cause blade contact or thrown object injuries.\n13. Many injuries occur as a result of the mower being pulled over the foot during a fall caused by slipping or tripping. Do not hold onto the mower if you are falling; release the handle immediately.\n14. Never pull the mower back toward you while you are walking. If you must back the mower away from a wall or obstruction first look down and behind to avoid tripping and then follow these steps:\n    - Step back from mower to fully extend your arms.\n    - Be sure you are well balanced with sure footing.\n    - Pull the mower back slowly, no more than halfway toward you.\n    - Repeat these steps as needed.\n15. Do not operate the mower while under the influence of alcohol or drugs.\n16. Do not engage the self-propelled mechanism on machines so equipped while starting engine.\n17. The blade control is a safety device. Never attempt to bypass its operation. Doing so makes the safety device inoperative and may result in personal injury through contact with the rotating blade. The blade control must operate easily in both directions and automatically return to the disengaged position when released.\n18. Never operate the mower in wet grass. Always be sure of your footing. A slip and fall can cause serious personal injury. If you feel you are losing your footing, release the blade control handle immediately and the blade will stop rotating within three seconds.\n19. Mow only in daylight or good artificial light. Walk, never run.\n20. Stop the blade when crossing gravel drives, walks or roads.\n21. If the equipment should start to vibrate abnormally, stop the engine and check immediately for the cause. Vibration is generally a warning of trouble.\n22. Shut the engine off and wait until the blade comes to a complete stop before removing the grass catcher or unclogging the chute. The cutting blade continues to rotate for a few seconds after the blade control is released. Never place any part of the body in the blade area until you are sure the blade has stopped rotating.\n23. Never operate mower without proper trail shield, discharge cover, grass catcher, blade control or other safety protective devices in place and working. Never operate mower with damaged safety devices. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.\n24. Muffler and engine become hot and can cause a burn. Do not touch.\n25. Never attempt to make a wheel or cutting height adjustment while the engine is running.\n26. Only use parts and accessories made for this machine by the manufacturer. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.",
            "27. When starting engine, pull cord slowly until resistance is felt, then pull rapidly. Rapid retraction of starter cord (kickback) will pull hand and arm toward engine faster than you can let go. Broken bones, fractures, bruises or sprains could result.\n28. If situations occur which are not covered in this manual, use care and good judgment. Contact Customer Support for assistance and the name of your nearest servicing dealer.",
            "### Children\n\nTragic accidents can occur if the operator is not alert to the presence of children. Children are often attracted to the mower and the mowing activity. They do not understand the dangers. Never assume that children will remain where you last saw them.\n\n1. Keep children out of the mowing area and under watchful care of a responsible adult other than the operator.\n2. Be alert and turn mower off if a child enters the area.\n3. Before and while moving backwards, look behind and down for small children.\n4. Use extreme care when approaching blind corners, doorways, shrubs, trees, or other objects that may block your vision of a child who may run into the mower.\n5. Keep children away from hot or running engines. They can suffer burns from a hot muffler.\n6. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and be trained and supervised by an adult.\n\n### Service\n\nSafe Handling of Gasoline\n\nTo avoid personal injury or property damage, use extreme care in handling gasoline. Gasoline is extremely flammable and the vapors are explosive. Serious personal injury can occur when gasoline is spilled on yourself or your clothes, which can ignite. Wash your skin and change clothes immediately.\n\n1. Use only an approved gasoline container.\n2. Never fill containers inside a vehicle or on a truck or trailer bed with a plastic liner. Always place containers on the ground away from your vehicle before filling.\n3. Remove gas-powered equipment from the truck or trailer and refuel it on the ground. If this is not possible, then refuel such equipment on a trailer with a portable container, rather than from a gasoline dispenser nozzle.\n4. Keep the nozzle in contact with the rim of the fuel tank or container opening at all times until fueling is complete. Do not use a nozzle lock-open device.\n5. Extinguish all cigarettes, cigars, pipes and other sources of ignition.\n6. Never fuel machine indoors because flammable vapors will accumulate in the area.\n7. Never remove gas cap or add fuel while the engine is hot or running. Allow engine to cool at least two minutes before refueling.\n8. Never overfill fuel tank. Fill tank to no more than \u00bd inch below bottom of filler neck to provide space for fuel expansion.\n9. Replace gasoline cap and tighten securely.\n10. If gasoline is spilled, wipe it off the engine and equipment. Move machine to another area. Wait 5 minutes before starting engine.\n11. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light (e.g. furnace, water heater, space heater, clothes dryer, etc.).\n12. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n13. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light such as a water heater, furnace, clothes dryer etc.\n14. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n\n---\n\n## General Service\n\n1. Never run an engine indoors or in a poorly ventilated area. Engine exhaust contains carbon monoxide, an odorless and deadly gas.\n2. Before cleaning, repairing, or inspecting, make certain the blade and all moving parts have stopped. Disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine to prevent unintended starting.\n3. Check the blade and engine mounting bolts at frequent intervals for proper tightness. Also, visually inspect blade for damage (e.g., bent, cracked, worn). Replace blade with the original equipment manufacturer\u2019s (O.E.M.) blade only, listed in this manual. \u201cUse of parts which do not meet the original equipment specifications may lead to improper performance and compromise safety!\u201d\n4. Mower blades are sharp and can cut. Wrap the blade or wear gloves, and use extra caution when servicing them.\n5. Keep all nuts, bolts, and screws tight to be sure the equipment is in safe working condition.\n6. Never tamper with safety devices. Check their proper operation regularly.\n7. After striking a foreign object, stop the engine, disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine. Thoroughly inspect the mower for any damage. Repair the damage before starting and operating the mower.\n8. Never attempt to make adjustments or repairs to the mower while the engine is running.\n9. Grass catcher components are subject to wear, damage and deterioration, which could expose moving parts or allow objects to be thrown. Frequently check components and replace with the manufacturer\u2019s recommended parts when necessary.\n10. Mower blades are sharp and can cut.

            "### DANGER\n\nThis machine was built to be operated according to the safe operation practices in this manual. As with any type of power equipment, carelessness or error on the part of the operator can result in serious injury. This machine is capable of amputating fingers, hands, toes and feet and throwing objects. Failure to observe the following safety instructions could result in serious injury or death.\n\n### General Operation",
            "1. Read this operator's manual carefully in its entirety before attempting to assemble this machine. Read, understand, and follow all instructions on the machine and in the manual(s) before operation. Keep this manual in a safe place for future and regular reference and for ordering replacement parts.\n2. Be completely familiar with the controls and the proper use of this machine before operating it.\n3. This machine is a precision piece of power equipment, not a plaything. Therefore, exercise extreme caution at all times. This machine has been designed to perform one job: to mow grass. Do not use it for any other purpose.\n4. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and should be trained and supervised by an adult.\n5. Only responsible individuals who are familiar with these rules of safe operation should be allowed to use this machine.\n6. Thoroughly inspect the area where the equipment is to be used. Remove all stones, sticks, wire, bones, toys and other foreign objects, which could be tripped over or picked up and thrown by the blade. Thrown objects can cause serious personal injury.\n7. Plan your mowing pattern to avoid discharge of material toward roads, sidewalks, bystanders and the like. Also, avoid discharging material against a wall or obstruction, which may cause discharged material to ricochet back toward the operator.\n8. To help avoid blade contact or a thrown object injury, stay in operator zone behind handles and keep children, bystanders, helpers and pets at least 75 feet from mower while it is in operation. Stop machine if anyone enters area.\n9. Always wear safety glasses or safety goggles during operation and while performing an adjustment or repair to protect your eyes. Thrown objects which ricochet can cause serious injury to the eyes.\n10. Wear sturdy, rough-soled work shoes and close-fitting slacks and shirts. Shirts and pants that cover the arms and legs and steel-toed shoes are recommended. Never operate this machine in bare feet, sandals, slippery or lightweight (e.g., canvas) shoes.\n11. Do not put hands or feet near rotating parts or under the cutting deck. Contact with blade can amputate fingers, hands, toes and feet.\n12. A missing or damaged discharge cover can cause blade contact or thrown object injuries.\n13. Many injuries occur as a result of the mower being pulled over the foot during a fall caused by slipping or tripping. Do not hold onto the mower if you are falling; release the handle immediately.\n14. Never pull the mower back toward you while you are walking. If you must back the mower away from a wall or obstruction first look down and behind to avoid tripping and then follow these steps:\n    - Step back from mower to fully extend your arms.\n    - Be sure you are well balanced with sure footing.\n    - Pull the mower back slowly, no more than halfway toward you.\n    - Repeat these steps as needed.\n15. Do not operate the mower while under the influence of alcohol or drugs.\n16. Do not engage the self-propelled mechanism on machines so equipped while starting engine.\n17. The blade control is a safety device. Never attempt to bypass its operation. Doing so makes the safety device inoperative and may result in personal injury through contact with the rotating blade. The blade control must operate easily in both directions and automatically return to the disengaged position when released.\n18. Never operate the mower in wet grass. Always be sure of your footing. A slip and fall can cause serious personal injury. If you feel you are losing your footing, release the blade control handle immediately and the blade will stop rotating within three seconds.\n19. Mow only in daylight or good artificial light. Walk, never run.\n20. Stop the blade when crossing gravel drives, walks or roads.\n21. If the equipment should start to vibrate abnormally, stop the engine and check immediately for the cause. Vibration is generally a warning of trouble.\n22. Shut the engine off and wait until the blade comes to a complete stop before removing the grass catcher or unclogging the chute. The cutting blade continues to rotate for a few seconds after the blade control is released. Never place any part of the body in the blade area until you are sure the blade has stopped rotating.\n23. Never operate mower without proper trail shield, discharge cover, grass catcher, blade control or other safety protective devices in place and working. Never operate mower with damaged safety devices. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.\n24. Muffler and engine become hot and can cause a burn. Do not touch.\n25. Never attempt to make a wheel or cutting height adjustment while the engine is running.\n26. Only use parts and accessories made for this machine by the manufacturer. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.",
            "27. When starting engine, pull cord slowly until resistance is felt, then pull rapidly. Rapid retraction of starter cord (kickback) will pull hand and arm toward engine faster than you can let go. Broken bones, fractures, bruises or sprains could result.\n28. If situations occur which are not covered in this manual, use care and good judgment. Contact Customer Support for assistance and the name of your nearest servicing dealer.",
            "### Children\n\nTragic accidents can occur if the operator is not alert to the presence of children. Children are often attracted to the mower and the mowing activity. They do not understand the dangers. Never assume that children will remain where you last saw them.\n\n1. Keep children out of the mowing area and under watchful care of a responsible adult other than the operator.\n2. Be alert and turn mower off if a child enters the area.\n3. Before and while moving backwards, look behind and down for small children.\n4. Use extreme care when approaching blind corners, doorways, shrubs, trees, or other objects that may block your vision of a child who may run into the mower.\n5. Keep children away from hot or running engines. They can suffer burns from a hot muffler.\n6. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and be trained and supervised by an adult.\n\n### Service\n\nSafe Handling of Gasoline\n\nTo avoid personal injury or property damage, use extreme care in handling gasoline. Gasoline is extremely flammable and the vapors are explosive. Serious personal injury can occur when gasoline is spilled on yourself or your clothes, which can ignite. Wash your skin and change clothes immediately.\n\n1. Use only an approved gasoline container.\n2. Never fill containers inside a vehicle or on a truck or trailer bed with a plastic liner. Always place containers on the ground away from your vehicle before filling.\n3. Remove gas-powered equipment from the truck or trailer and refuel it on the ground. If this is not possible, then refuel such equipment on a trailer with a portable container, rather than from a gasoline dispenser nozzle.\n4. Keep the nozzle in contact with the rim of the fuel tank or container opening at all times until fueling is complete. Do not use a nozzle lock-open device.\n5. Extinguish all cigarettes, cigars, pipes and other sources of ignition.\n6. Never fuel machine indoors because flammable vapors will accumulate in the area.\n7. Never remove gas cap or add fuel while the engine is hot or running. Allow engine to cool at least two minutes before refueling.\n8. Never overfill fuel tank. Fill tank to no more than \u00bd inch below bottom of filler neck to provide space for fuel expansion.\n9. Replace gasoline cap and tighten securely.\n10. If gasoline is spilled, wipe it off the engine and equipment. Move machine to another area. Wait 5 minutes before starting engine.\n11. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light (e.g. furnace, water heater, space heater, clothes dryer, etc.).\n12. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n13. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light such as a water heater, furnace, clothes dryer etc.\n14. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n\n---\n\n## General Service\n\n1. Never run an engine indoors or in a poorly ventilated area. Engine exhaust contains carbon monoxide, an odorless and deadly gas.\n2. Before cleaning, repairing, or inspecting, make certain the blade and all moving parts have stopped. Disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine to prevent unintended starting.\n3. Check the blade and engine mounting bolts at frequent intervals for proper tightness. Also, visually inspect blade for damage (e.g., bent, cracked, worn). Replace blade with the original equipment manufacturer\u2019s (O.E.M.) blade only, listed in this manual. \u201cUse of parts which do not meet the original equipment specifications may lead to improper performance and compromise safety!\u201d\n4. Mower blades are sharp and can cut. Wrap the blade or wear gloves, and use extra caution when servicing them.\n5. Keep all nuts, bolts, and screws tight to be sure the equipment is in safe working condition.\n6. Never tamper with safety devices. Check their proper operation regularly.\n7. After striking a foreign object, stop the engine, disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine. Thoroughly inspect the mower for any damage. Repair the damage before starting and operating the mower.\n8. Never attempt to make adjustments or repairs to the mower while the engine is running.\n9. Grass catcher components are subject to wear, damage and deterioration, which could expose moving parts or allow objects to be thrown. Frequently check components and replace with the manufacturer\u2019s recommended parts when necessary.\n10. Mower blades are sharp and can cut.

            "### DANGER\n\nThis machine was built to be operated according to the safe operation practices in this manual. As with any type of power equipment, carelessness or error on the part of the operator can result in serious injury. This machine is capable of amputating fingers, hands, toes and feet and throwing objects. Failure to observe the following safety instructions could result in serious injury or death.\n\n### General Operation",
            "1. Read this operator's manual carefully in its entirety before attempting to assemble this machine. Read, understand, and follow all instructions on the machine and in the manual(s) before operation. Keep this manual in a safe place for future and regular reference and for ordering replacement parts.\n2. Be completely familiar with the controls and the proper use of this machine before operating it.\n3. This machine is a precision piece of power equipment, not a plaything. Therefore, exercise extreme caution at all times. This machine has been designed to perform one job: to mow grass. Do not use it for any other purpose.\n4. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and should be trained and supervised by an adult.\n5. Only responsible individuals who are familiar with these rules of safe operation should be allowed to use this machine.\n6. Thoroughly inspect the area where the equipment is to be used. Remove all stones, sticks, wire, bones, toys and other foreign objects, which could be tripped over or picked up and thrown by the blade. Thrown objects can cause serious personal injury.\n7. Plan your mowing pattern to avoid discharge of material toward roads, sidewalks, bystanders and the like. Also, avoid discharging material against a wall or obstruction, which may cause discharged material to ricochet back toward the operator.\n8. To help avoid blade contact or a thrown object injury, stay in operator zone behind handles and keep children, bystanders, helpers and pets at least 75 feet from mower while it is in operation. Stop machine if anyone enters area.\n9. Always wear safety glasses or safety goggles during operation and while performing an adjustment or repair to protect your eyes. Thrown objects which ricochet can cause serious injury to the eyes.\n10. Wear sturdy, rough-soled work shoes and close-fitting slacks and shirts. Shirts and pants that cover the arms and legs and steel-toed shoes are recommended. Never operate this machine in bare feet, sandals, slippery or lightweight (e.g., canvas) shoes.\n11. Do not put hands or feet near rotating parts or under the cutting deck. Contact with blade can amputate fingers, hands, toes and feet.\n12. A missing or damaged discharge cover can cause blade contact or thrown object injuries.\n13. Many injuries occur as a result of the mower being pulled over the foot during a fall caused by slipping or tripping. Do not hold onto the mower if you are falling; release the handle immediately.\n14. Never pull the mower back toward you while you are walking. If you must back the mower away from a wall or obstruction first look down and behind to avoid tripping and then follow these steps:\n    - Step back from mower to fully extend your arms.\n    - Be sure you are well balanced with sure footing.\n    - Pull the mower back slowly, no more than halfway toward you.\n    - Repeat these steps as needed.\n15. Do not operate the mower while under the influence of alcohol or drugs.\n16. Do not engage the self-propelled mechanism on machines so equipped while starting engine.\n17. The blade control is a safety device. Never attempt to bypass its operation. Doing so makes the safety device inoperative and may result in personal injury through contact with the rotating blade. The blade control must operate easily in both directions and automatically return to the disengaged position when released.\n18. Never operate the mower in wet grass. Always be sure of your footing. A slip and fall can cause serious personal injury. If you feel you are losing your footing, release the blade control handle immediately and the blade will stop rotating within three seconds.\n19. Mow only in daylight or good artificial light. Walk, never run.\n20. Stop the blade when crossing gravel drives, walks or roads.\n21. If the equipment should start to vibrate abnormally, stop the engine and check immediately for the cause. Vibration is generally a warning of trouble.\n22. Shut the engine off and wait until the blade comes to a complete stop before removing the grass catcher or unclogging the chute. The cutting blade continues to rotate for a few seconds after the blade control is released. Never place any part of the body in the blade area until you are sure the blade has stopped rotating.\n23. Never operate mower without proper trail shield, discharge cover, grass catcher, blade control or other safety protective devices in place and working. Never operate mower with damaged safety devices. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.\n24. Muffler and engine become hot and can cause a burn. Do not touch.\n25. Never attempt to make a wheel or cutting height adjustment while the engine is running.\n26. Only use parts and accessories made for this machine by the manufacturer. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.",
            "27. When starting engine, pull cord slowly until resistance is felt, then pull rapidly. Rapid retraction of starter cord (kickback) will pull hand and arm toward engine faster than you can let go. Broken bones, fractures, bruises or sprains could result.\n28. If situations occur which are not covered in this manual, use care and good judgment. Contact Customer Support for assistance and the name of your nearest servicing dealer.",
            "### Children\n\nTragic accidents can occur if the operator is not alert to the presence of children. Children are often attracted to the mower and the mowing activity. They do not understand the dangers. Never assume that children will remain where you last saw them.\n\n1. Keep children out of the mowing area and under watchful care of a responsible adult other than the operator.\n2. Be alert and turn mower off if a child enters the area.\n3. Before and while moving backwards, look behind and down for small children.\n4. Use extreme care when approaching blind corners, doorways, shrubs, trees, or other objects that may block your vision of a child who may run into the mower.\n5. Keep children away from hot or running engines. They can suffer burns from a hot muffler.\n6. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and be trained and supervised by an adult.\n\n### Service\n\nSafe Handling of Gasoline\n\nTo avoid personal injury or property damage, use extreme care in handling gasoline. Gasoline is extremely flammable and the vapors are explosive. Serious personal injury can occur when gasoline is spilled on yourself or your clothes, which can ignite. Wash your skin and change clothes immediately.\n\n1. Use only an approved gasoline container.\n2. Never fill containers inside a vehicle or on a truck or trailer bed with a plastic liner. Always place containers on the ground away from your vehicle before filling.\n3. Remove gas-powered equipment from the truck or trailer and refuel it on the ground. If this is not possible, then refuel such equipment on a trailer with a portable container, rather than from a gasoline dispenser nozzle.\n4. Keep the nozzle in contact with the rim of the fuel tank or container opening at all times until fueling is complete. Do not use a nozzle lock-open device.\n5. Extinguish all cigarettes, cigars, pipes and other sources of ignition.\n6. Never fuel machine indoors because flammable vapors will accumulate in the area.\n7. Never remove gas cap or add fuel while the engine is hot or running. Allow engine to cool at least two minutes before refueling.\n8. Never overfill fuel tank. Fill tank to no more than \u00bd inch below bottom of filler neck to provide space for fuel expansion.\n9. Replace gasoline cap and tighten securely.\n10. If gasoline is spilled, wipe it off the engine and equipment. Move machine to another area. Wait 5 minutes before starting engine.\n11. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light (e.g. furnace, water heater, space heater, clothes dryer, etc.).\n12. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n13. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light such as a water heater, furnace, clothes dryer etc.\n14. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n\n---\n\n## General Service\n\n1. Never run an engine indoors or in a poorly ventilated area. Engine exhaust contains carbon monoxide, an odorless and deadly gas.\n2. Before cleaning, repairing, or inspecting, make certain the blade and all moving parts have stopped. Disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine to prevent unintended starting.\n3. Check the blade and engine mounting bolts at frequent intervals for proper tightness. Also, visually inspect blade for damage (e.g., bent, cracked, worn). Replace blade with the original equipment manufacturer\u2019s (O.E.M.) blade only, listed in this manual. \u201cUse of parts which do not meet the original equipment specifications may lead to improper performance and compromise safety!\u201d\n4. Mower blades are sharp and can cut. Wrap the blade or wear gloves, and use extra caution when servicing them.\n5. Keep all nuts, bolts, and screws tight to be sure the equipment is in safe working condition.\n6. Never tamper with safety devices. Check their proper operation regularly.\n7. After striking a foreign object, stop the engine, disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine. Thoroughly inspect the mower for any damage. Repair the damage before starting and operating the mower.\n8. Never attempt to make adjustments or repairs to the mower while the engine is running.\n9. Grass catcher components are subject to wear, damage and deterioration, which could expose moving parts or allow objects to be thrown. Frequently check components and replace with the manufacturer\u2019s recommended parts when necessary.\n10. Mower blades are sharp and can cut.

            "### DANGER\n\nThis machine was built to be operated according to the safe operation practices in this manual. As with any type of power equipment, carelessness or error on the part of the operator can result in serious injury. This machine is capable of amputating fingers, hands, toes and feet and throwing objects. Failure to observe the following safety instructions could result in serious injury or death.\n\n### General Operation",
            "1. Read this operator's manual carefully in its entirety before attempting to assemble this machine. Read, understand, and follow all instructions on the machine and in the manual(s) before operation. Keep this manual in a safe place for future and regular reference and for ordering replacement parts.\n2. Be completely familiar with the controls and the proper use of this machine before operating it.\n3. This machine is a precision piece of power equipment, not a plaything. Therefore, exercise extreme caution at all times. This machine has been designed to perform one job: to mow grass. Do not use it for any other purpose.\n4. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and should be trained and supervised by an adult.\n5. Only responsible individuals who are familiar with these rules of safe operation should be allowed to use this machine.\n6. Thoroughly inspect the area where the equipment is to be used. Remove all stones, sticks, wire, bones, toys and other foreign objects, which could be tripped over or picked up and thrown by the blade. Thrown objects can cause serious personal injury.\n7. Plan your mowing pattern to avoid discharge of material toward roads, sidewalks, bystanders and the like. Also, avoid discharging material against a wall or obstruction, which may cause discharged material to ricochet back toward the operator.\n8. To help avoid blade contact or a thrown object injury, stay in operator zone behind handles and keep children, bystanders, helpers and pets at least 75 feet from mower while it is in operation. Stop machine if anyone enters area.\n9. Always wear safety glasses or safety goggles during operation and while performing an adjustment or repair to protect your eyes. Thrown objects which ricochet can cause serious injury to the eyes.\n10. Wear sturdy, rough-soled work shoes and close-fitting slacks and shirts. Shirts and pants that cover the arms and legs and steel-toed shoes are recommended. Never operate this machine in bare feet, sandals, slippery or lightweight (e.g., canvas) shoes.\n11. Do not put hands or feet near rotating parts or under the cutting deck. Contact with blade can amputate fingers, hands, toes and feet.\n12. A missing or damaged discharge cover can cause blade contact or thrown object injuries.\n13. Many injuries occur as a result of the mower being pulled over the foot during a fall caused by slipping or tripping. Do not hold onto the mower if you are falling; release the handle immediately.\n14. Never pull the mower back toward you while you are walking. If you must back the mower away from a wall or obstruction first look down and behind to avoid tripping and then follow these steps:\n    - Step back from mower to fully extend your arms.\n    - Be sure you are well balanced with sure footing.\n    - Pull the mower back slowly, no more than halfway toward you.\n    - Repeat these steps as needed.\n15. Do not operate the mower while under the influence of alcohol or drugs.\n16. Do not engage the self-propelled mechanism on machines so equipped while starting engine.\n17. The blade control is a safety device. Never attempt to bypass its operation. Doing so makes the safety device inoperative and may result in personal injury through contact with the rotating blade. The blade control must operate easily in both directions and automatically return to the disengaged position when released.\n18. Never operate the mower in wet grass. Always be sure of your footing. A slip and fall can cause serious personal injury. If you feel you are losing your footing, release the blade control handle immediately and the blade will stop rotating within three seconds.\n19. Mow only in daylight or good artificial light. Walk, never run.\n20. Stop the blade when crossing gravel drives, walks or roads.\n21. If the equipment should start to vibrate abnormally, stop the engine and check immediately for the cause. Vibration is generally a warning of trouble.\n22. Shut the engine off and wait until the blade comes to a complete stop before removing the grass catcher or unclogging the chute. The cutting blade continues to rotate for a few seconds after the blade control is released. Never place any part of the body in the blade area until you are sure the blade has stopped rotating.\n23. Never operate mower without proper trail shield, discharge cover, grass catcher, blade control or other safety protective devices in place and working. Never operate mower with damaged safety devices. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.\n24. Muffler and engine become hot and can cause a burn. Do not touch.\n25. Never attempt to make a wheel or cutting height adjustment while the engine is running.\n26. Only use parts and accessories made for this machine by the manufacturer. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.",
            "27. When starting engine, pull cord slowly until resistance is felt, then pull rapidly. Rapid retraction of starter cord (kickback) will pull hand and arm toward engine faster than you can let go. Broken bones, fractures, bruises or sprains could result.\n28. If situations occur which are not covered in this manual, use care and good judgment. Contact Customer Support for assistance and the name of your nearest servicing dealer.",
            "### Children\n\nTragic accidents can occur if the operator is not alert to the presence of children. Children are often attracted to the mower and the mowing activity. They do not understand the dangers. Never assume that children will remain where you last saw them.\n\n1. Keep children out of the mowing area and under watchful care of a responsible adult other than the operator.\n2. Be alert and turn mower off if a child enters the area.\n3. Before and while moving backwards, look behind and down for small children.\n4. Use extreme care when approaching blind corners, doorways, shrubs, trees, or other objects that may block your vision of a child who may run into the mower.\n5. Keep children away from hot or running engines. They can suffer burns from a hot muffler.\n6. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and be trained and supervised by an adult.\n\n### Service\n\nSafe Handling of Gasoline\n\nTo avoid personal injury or property damage, use extreme care in handling gasoline. Gasoline is extremely flammable and the vapors are explosive. Serious personal injury can occur when gasoline is spilled on yourself or your clothes, which can ignite. Wash your skin and change clothes immediately.\n\n1. Use only an approved gasoline container.\n2. Never fill containers inside a vehicle or on a truck or trailer bed with a plastic liner. Always place containers on the ground away from your vehicle before filling.\n3. Remove gas-powered equipment from the truck or trailer and refuel it on the ground. If this is not possible, then refuel such equipment on a trailer with a portable container, rather than from a gasoline dispenser nozzle.\n4. Keep the nozzle in contact with the rim of the fuel tank or container opening at all times until fueling is complete. Do not use a nozzle lock-open device.\n5. Extinguish all cigarettes, cigars, pipes and other sources of ignition.\n6. Never fuel machine indoors because flammable vapors will accumulate in the area.\n7. Never remove gas cap or add fuel while the engine is hot or running. Allow engine to cool at least two minutes before refueling.\n8. Never overfill fuel tank. Fill tank to no more than \u00bd inch below bottom of filler neck to provide space for fuel expansion.\n9. Replace gasoline cap and tighten securely.\n10. If gasoline is spilled, wipe it off the engine and equipment. Move machine to another area. Wait 5 minutes before starting engine.\n11. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light (e.g. furnace, water heater, space heater, clothes dryer, etc.).\n12. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n13. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light such as a water heater, furnace, clothes dryer etc.\n14. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n\n---\n\n## General Service\n\n1. Never run an engine indoors or in a poorly ventilated area. Engine exhaust contains carbon monoxide, an odorless and deadly gas.\n2. Before cleaning, repairing, or inspecting, make certain the blade and all moving parts have stopped. Disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine to prevent unintended starting.\n3. Check the blade and engine mounting bolts at frequent intervals for proper tightness. Also, visually inspect blade for damage (e.g., bent, cracked, worn). Replace blade with the original equipment manufacturer\u2019s (O.E.M.) blade only, listed in this manual. \u201cUse of parts which do not meet the original equipment specifications may lead to improper performance and compromise safety!\u201d\n4. Mower blades are sharp and can cut. Wrap the blade or wear gloves, and use extra caution when servicing them.\n5. Keep all nuts, bolts, and screws tight to be sure the equipment is in safe working condition.\n6. Never tamper with safety devices. Check their proper operation regularly.\n7. After striking a foreign object, stop the engine, disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine. Thoroughly inspect the mower for any damage. Repair the damage before starting and operating the mower.\n8. Never attempt to make adjustments or repairs to the mower while the engine is running.\n9. Grass catcher components are subject to wear, damage and deterioration, which could expose moving parts or allow objects to be thrown. Frequently check components and replace with the manufacturer\u2019s recommended parts when necessary.\n10. Mower blades are sharp and can cut. Wrap the blade or wear gloves, and use extra caution when servicing them.\n11. Do not change the engine governor setting or over-speed the engine.

            "### DANGER\n\nThis machine was built to be operated according to the safe operation practices in this manual. As with any type of power equipment, carelessness or error on the part of the operator can result in serious injury. This machine is capable of amputating fingers, hands, toes and feet and throwing objects. Failure to observe the following safety instructions could result in serious injury or death.\n\n### General Operation",
            "1. Read this operator's manual carefully in its entirety before attempting to assemble this machine. Read, understand, and follow all instructions on the machine and in the manual(s) before operation. Keep this manual in a safe place for future and regular reference and for ordering replacement parts.\n2. Be completely familiar with the controls and the proper use of this machine before operating it.\n3. This machine is a precision piece of power equipment, not a plaything. Therefore, exercise extreme caution at all times. This machine has been designed to perform one job: to mow grass. Do not use it for any other purpose.\n4. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and should be trained and supervised by an adult.\n5. Only responsible individuals who are familiar with these rules of safe operation should be allowed to use this machine.\n6. Thoroughly inspect the area where the equipment is to be used. Remove all stones, sticks, wire, bones, toys and other foreign objects, which could be tripped over or picked up and thrown by the blade. Thrown objects can cause serious personal injury.\n7. Plan your mowing pattern to avoid discharge of material toward roads, sidewalks, bystanders and the like. Also, avoid discharging material against a wall or obstruction, which may cause discharged material to ricochet back toward the operator.\n8. To help avoid blade contact or a thrown object injury, stay in operator zone behind handles and keep children, bystanders, helpers and pets at least 75 feet from mower while it is in operation. Stop machine if anyone enters area.\n9. Always wear safety glasses or safety goggles during operation and while performing an adjustment or repair to protect your eyes. Thrown objects which ricochet can cause serious injury to the eyes.\n10. Wear sturdy, rough-soled work shoes and close-fitting slacks and shirts. Shirts and pants that cover the arms and legs and steel-toed shoes are recommended. Never operate this machine in bare feet, sandals, slippery or lightweight (e.g., canvas) shoes.\n11. Do not put hands or feet near rotating parts or under the cutting deck. Contact with blade can amputate fingers, hands, toes and feet.\n12. A missing or damaged discharge cover can cause blade contact or thrown object injuries.\n13. Many injuries occur as a result of the mower being pulled over the foot during a fall caused by slipping or tripping. Do not hold onto the mower if you are falling; release the handle immediately.\n14. Never pull the mower back toward you while you are walking. If you must back the mower away from a wall or obstruction first look down and behind to avoid tripping and then follow these steps:\n    - Step back from mower to fully extend your arms.\n    - Be sure you are well balanced with sure footing.\n    - Pull the mower back slowly, no more than halfway toward you.\n    - Repeat these steps as needed.\n15. Do not operate the mower while under the influence of alcohol or drugs.\n16. Do not engage the self-propelled mechanism on machines so equipped while starting engine.\n17. The blade control is a safety device. Never attempt to bypass its operation. Doing so makes the safety device inoperative and may result in personal injury through contact with the rotating blade. The blade control must operate easily in both directions and automatically return to the disengaged position when released.\n18. Never operate the mower in wet grass. Always be sure of your footing. A slip and fall can cause serious personal injury. If you feel you are losing your footing, release the blade control handle immediately and the blade will stop rotating within three seconds.\n19. Mow only in daylight or good artificial light. Walk, never run.\n20. Stop the blade when crossing gravel drives, walks or roads.\n21. If the equipment should start to vibrate abnormally, stop the engine and check immediately for the cause. Vibration is generally a warning of trouble.\n22. Shut the engine off and wait until the blade comes to a complete stop before removing the grass catcher or unclogging the chute. The cutting blade continues to rotate for a few seconds after the blade control is released. Never place any part of the body in the blade area until you are sure the blade has stopped rotating.\n23. Never operate mower without proper trail shield, discharge cover, grass catcher, blade control or other safety protective devices in place and working. Never operate mower with damaged safety devices. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.\n24. Muffler and engine become hot and can cause a burn. Do not touch.\n25. Never attempt to make a wheel or cutting height adjustment while the engine is running.\n26. Only use parts and accessories made for this machine by the manufacturer. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.",
            "27. When starting engine, pull cord slowly until resistance is felt, then pull rapidly. Rapid retraction of starter cord (kickback) will pull hand and arm toward engine faster than you can let go. Broken bones, fractures, bruises or sprains could result.\n28. If situations occur which are not covered in this manual, use care and good judgment. Contact Customer Support for assistance and the name of your nearest servicing dealer.",
            "### Children\n\nTragic accidents can occur if the operator is not alert to the presence of children. Children are often attracted to the mower and the mowing activity. They do not understand the dangers. Never assume that children will remain where you last saw them.\n\n1. Keep children out of the mowing area and under watchful care of a responsible adult other than the operator.\n2. Be alert and turn mower off if a child enters the area.\n3. Before and while moving backwards, look behind and down for small children.\n4. Use extreme care when approaching blind corners, doorways, shrubs, trees, or other objects that may block your vision of a child who may run into the mower.\n5. Keep children away from hot or running engines. They can suffer burns from a hot muffler.\n6. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and be trained and supervised by an adult.\n\n### Service\n\nSafe Handling of Gasoline\n\nTo avoid personal injury or property damage, use extreme care in handling gasoline. Gasoline is extremely flammable and the vapors are explosive. Serious personal injury can occur when gasoline is spilled on yourself or your clothes, which can ignite. Wash your skin and change clothes immediately.\n\n1. Use only an approved gasoline container.\n2. Never fill containers inside a vehicle or on a truck or trailer bed with a plastic liner. Always place containers on the ground away from your vehicle before filling.\n3. Remove gas-powered equipment from the truck or trailer and refuel it on the ground. If this is not possible, then refuel such equipment on a trailer with a portable container, rather than from a gasoline dispenser nozzle.\n4. Keep the nozzle in contact with the rim of the fuel tank or container opening at all times until fueling is complete. Do not use a nozzle lock-open device.\n5. Extinguish all cigarettes, cigars, pipes and other sources of ignition.\n6. Never fuel machine indoors because flammable vapors will accumulate in the area.\n7. Never remove gas cap or add fuel while the engine is hot or running. Allow engine to cool at least two minutes before refueling.\n8. Never overfill fuel tank. Fill tank to no more than \u00bd inch below bottom of filler neck to provide space for fuel expansion.\n9. Replace gasoline cap and tighten securely.\n10. If gasoline is spilled, wipe it off the engine and equipment. Move machine to another area. Wait 5 minutes before starting engine.\n11. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light (e.g. furnace, water heater, space heater, clothes dryer, etc.).\n12. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n13. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light such as a water heater, furnace, clothes dryer etc.\n14. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n\n---\n\n## General Service\n\n1. Never run an engine indoors or in a poorly ventilated area. Engine exhaust contains carbon monoxide, an odorless and deadly gas.\n2. Before cleaning, repairing, or inspecting, make certain the blade and all moving parts have stopped. Disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine to prevent unintended starting.\n3. Check the blade and engine mounting bolts at frequent intervals for proper tightness. Also, visually inspect blade for damage (e.g., bent, cracked, worn). Replace blade with the original equipment manufacturer\u2019s (O.E.M.) blade only, listed in this manual. \u201cUse of parts which do not meet the original equipment specifications may lead to improper performance and compromise safety!\u201d\n4. Mower blades are sharp and can cut. Wrap the blade or wear gloves, and use extra caution when servicing them.\n5. Keep all nuts, bolts, and screws tight to be sure the equipment is in safe working condition.\n6. Never tamper with safety devices. Check their proper operation regularly.\n7. After striking a foreign object, stop the engine, disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine. Thoroughly inspect the mower for any damage. Repair the damage before starting and operating the mower.\n8. Never attempt to make adjustments or repairs to the mower while the engine is running.\n9. Grass catcher components are subject to wear, damage and deterioration, which could expose moving parts or allow objects to be thrown. Frequently check components and replace with the manufacturer\u2019s recommended parts when necessary.\n10. Mower blades are sharp and can cut.

            "### DANGER\n\nThis machine was built to be operated according to the safe operation practices in this manual. As with any type of power equipment, carelessness or error on the part of the operator can result in serious injury. This machine is capable of amputating fingers, hands, toes and feet and throwing objects. Failure to observe the following safety instructions could result in serious injury or death.\n\n### General Operation",
            "1. Read this operator's manual carefully in its entirety before attempting to assemble this machine. Read, understand, and follow all instructions on the machine and in the manual(s) before operation. Keep this manual in a safe place for future and regular reference and for ordering replacement parts.\n2. Be completely familiar with the controls and the proper use of this machine before operating it.\n3. This machine is a precision piece of power equipment, not a plaything. Therefore, exercise extreme caution at all times. This machine has been designed to perform one job: to mow grass. Do not use it for any other purpose.\n4. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and should be trained and supervised by an adult.\n5. Only responsible individuals who are familiar with these rules of safe operation should be allowed to use this machine.\n6. Thoroughly inspect the area where the equipment is to be used. Remove all stones, sticks, wire, bones, toys and other foreign objects, which could be tripped over or picked up and thrown by the blade. Thrown objects can cause serious personal injury.\n7. Plan your mowing pattern to avoid discharge of material toward roads, sidewalks, bystanders and the like. Also, avoid discharging material against a wall or obstruction, which may cause discharged material to ricochet back toward the operator.\n8. To help avoid blade contact or a thrown object injury, stay in operator zone behind handles and keep children, bystanders, helpers and pets at least 75 feet from mower while it is in operation. Stop machine if anyone enters area.\n9. Always wear safety glasses or safety goggles during operation and while performing an adjustment or repair to protect your eyes. Thrown objects which ricochet can cause serious injury to the eyes.\n10. Wear sturdy, rough-soled work shoes and close-fitting slacks and shirts. Shirts and pants that cover the arms and legs and steel-toed shoes are recommended. Never operate this machine in bare feet, sandals, slippery or lightweight (e.g., canvas) shoes.\n11. Do not put hands or feet near rotating parts or under the cutting deck. Contact with blade can amputate fingers, hands, toes and feet.\n12. A missing or damaged discharge cover can cause blade contact or thrown object injuries.\n13. Many injuries occur as a result of the mower being pulled over the foot during a fall caused by slipping or tripping. Do not hold onto the mower if you are falling; release the handle immediately.\n14. Never pull the mower back toward you while you are walking. If you must back the mower away from a wall or obstruction first look down and behind to avoid tripping and then follow these steps:\n    - Step back from mower to fully extend your arms.\n    - Be sure you are well balanced with sure footing.\n    - Pull the mower back slowly, no more than halfway toward you.\n    - Repeat these steps as needed.\n15. Do not operate the mower while under the influence of alcohol or drugs.\n16. Do not engage the self-propelled mechanism on machines so equipped while starting engine.\n17. The blade control is a safety device. Never attempt to bypass its operation. Doing so makes the safety device inoperative and may result in personal injury through contact with the rotating blade. The blade control must operate easily in both directions and automatically return to the disengaged position when released.\n18. Never operate the mower in wet grass. Always be sure of your footing. A slip and fall can cause serious personal injury. If you feel you are losing your footing, release the blade control handle immediately and the blade will stop rotating within three seconds.\n19. Mow only in daylight or good artificial light. Walk, never run.\n20. Stop the blade when crossing gravel drives, walks or roads.\n21. If the equipment should start to vibrate abnormally, stop the engine and check immediately for the cause. Vibration is generally a warning of trouble.\n22. Shut the engine off and wait until the blade comes to a complete stop before removing the grass catcher or unclogging the chute. The cutting blade continues to rotate for a few seconds after the blade control is released. Never place any part of the body in the blade area until you are sure the blade has stopped rotating.\n23. Never operate mower without proper trail shield, discharge cover, grass catcher, blade control or other safety protective devices in place and working. Never operate mower with damaged safety devices. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.\n24. Muffler and engine become hot and can cause a burn. Do not touch.\n25. Never attempt to make a wheel or cutting height adjustment while the engine is running.\n26. Only use parts and accessories made for this machine by the manufacturer. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.",
            "27. When starting engine, pull cord slowly until resistance is felt, then pull rapidly. Rapid retraction of starter cord (kickback) will pull hand and arm toward engine faster than you can let go. Broken bones, fractures, bruises or sprains could result.\n28. If situations occur which are not covered in this manual, use care and good judgment. Contact Customer Support for assistance and the name of your nearest servicing dealer.",
            "### Children\n\nTragic accidents can occur if the operator is not alert to the presence of children. Children are often attracted to the mower and the mowing activity. They do not understand the dangers. Never assume that children will remain where you last saw them.\n\n1. Keep children out of the mowing area and under watchful care of a responsible adult other than the operator.\n2. Be alert and turn mower off if a child enters the area.\n3. Before and while moving backwards, look behind and down for small children.\n4. Use extreme care when approaching blind corners, doorways, shrubs, trees, or other objects that may block your vision of a child who may run into the mower.\n5. Keep children away from hot or running engines. They can suffer burns from a hot muffler.\n6. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and be trained and supervised by an adult.\n\n### Service\n\nSafe Handling of Gasoline\n\nTo avoid personal injury or property damage, use extreme care in handling gasoline. Gasoline is extremely flammable and the vapors are explosive. Serious personal injury can occur when gasoline is spilled on yourself or your clothes, which can ignite. Wash your skin and change clothes immediately.\n\n1. Use only an approved gasoline container.\n2. Never fill containers inside a vehicle or on a truck or trailer bed with a plastic liner. Always place containers on the ground away from your vehicle before filling.\n3. Remove gas-powered equipment from the truck or trailer and refuel it on the ground. If this is not possible, then refuel such equipment on a trailer with a portable container, rather than from a gasoline dispenser nozzle.\n4. Keep the nozzle in contact with the rim of the fuel tank or container opening at all times until fueling is complete. Do not use a nozzle lock-open device.\n5. Extinguish all cigarettes, cigars, pipes and other sources of ignition.\n6. Never fuel machine indoors because flammable vapors will accumulate in the area.\n7. Never remove gas cap or add fuel while the engine is hot or running. Allow engine to cool at least two minutes before refueling.\n8. Never overfill fuel tank. Fill tank to no more than \u00bd inch below bottom of filler neck to provide space for fuel expansion.\n9. Replace gasoline cap and tighten securely.\n10. If gasoline is spilled, wipe it off the engine and equipment. Move machine to another area. Wait 5 minutes before starting engine.\n11. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light (e.g. furnace, water heater, space heater, clothes dryer, etc.).\n12. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n13. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light such as a water heater, furnace, clothes dryer etc.\n14. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n\n---\n\n## General Service\n\n1. Never run an engine indoors or in a poorly ventilated area. Engine exhaust contains carbon monoxide, an odorless and deadly gas.\n2. Before cleaning, repairing, or inspecting, make certain the blade and all moving parts have stopped. Disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine to prevent unintended starting.\n3. Check the blade and engine mounting bolts at frequent intervals for proper tightness. Also, visually inspect blade for damage (e.g., bent, cracked, worn). Replace blade with the original equipment manufacturer\u2019s (O.E.M.) blade only, listed in this manual. \u201cUse of parts which do not meet the original equipment specifications may lead to improper performance and compromise safety!\u201d\n4. Mower blades are sharp and can cut. Wrap the blade or wear gloves, and use extra caution when servicing them.\n5. Keep all nuts, bolts, and screws tight to be sure the equipment is in safe working condition.\n6. Never tamper with safety devices. Check their proper operation regularly.\n7. After striking a foreign object, stop the engine, disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine. Thoroughly inspect the mower for any damage. Repair the damage before starting and operating the mower.\n8. Never attempt to make adjustments or repairs to the mower while the engine is running.\n9. Grass catcher components are subject to wear, damage and deterioration, which could expose moving parts or allow objects to be thrown. Frequently check components and replace with the manufacturer\u2019s recommended parts when necessary.\n10. Mower blades are sharp and can cut. Wrap the blade or wear gloves, and use extra caution when servicing them.\n11. Do not change the engine governor setting or over-speed the engine.

            "### DANGER\n\nThis machine was built to be operated according to the safe operation practices in this manual. As with any type of power equipment, carelessness or error on the part of the operator can result in serious injury. This machine is capable of amputating fingers, hands, toes and feet and throwing objects. Failure to observe the following safety instructions could result in serious injury or death.\n\n### General Operation",
            "1. Read this operator's manual carefully in its entirety before attempting to assemble this machine. Read, understand, and follow all instructions on the machine and in the manual(s) before operation. Keep this manual in a safe place for future and regular reference and for ordering replacement parts.\n2. Be completely familiar with the controls and the proper use of this machine before operating it.\n3. This machine is a precision piece of power equipment, not a plaything. Therefore, exercise extreme caution at all times. This machine has been designed to perform one job: to mow grass. Do not use it for any other purpose.\n4. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and should be trained and supervised by an adult.\n5. Only responsible individuals who are familiar with these rules of safe operation should be allowed to use this machine.\n6. Thoroughly inspect the area where the equipment is to be used. Remove all stones, sticks, wire, bones, toys and other foreign objects, which could be tripped over or picked up and thrown by the blade. Thrown objects can cause serious personal injury.\n7. Plan your mowing pattern to avoid discharge of material toward roads, sidewalks, bystanders and the like. Also, avoid discharging material against a wall or obstruction, which may cause discharged material to ricochet back toward the operator.\n8. To help avoid blade contact or a thrown object injury, stay in operator zone behind handles and keep children, bystanders, helpers and pets at least 75 feet from mower while it is in operation. Stop machine if anyone enters area.\n9. Always wear safety glasses or safety goggles during operation and while performing an adjustment or repair to protect your eyes. Thrown objects which ricochet can cause serious injury to the eyes.\n10. Wear sturdy, rough-soled work shoes and close-fitting slacks and shirts. Shirts and pants that cover the arms and legs and steel-toed shoes are recommended. Never operate this machine in bare feet, sandals, slippery or lightweight (e.g., canvas) shoes.\n11. Do not put hands or feet near rotating parts or under the cutting deck. Contact with blade can amputate fingers, hands, toes and feet.\n12. A missing or damaged discharge cover can cause blade contact or thrown object injuries.\n13. Many injuries occur as a result of the mower being pulled over the foot during a fall caused by slipping or tripping. Do not hold onto the mower if you are falling; release the handle immediately.\n14. Never pull the mower back toward you while you are walking. If you must back the mower away from a wall or obstruction first look down and behind to avoid tripping and then follow these steps:\n    - Step back from mower to fully extend your arms.\n    - Be sure you are well balanced with sure footing.\n    - Pull the mower back slowly, no more than halfway toward you.\n    - Repeat these steps as needed.\n15. Do not operate the mower while under the influence of alcohol or drugs.\n16. Do not engage the self-propelled mechanism on machines so equipped while starting engine.\n17. The blade control is a safety device. Never attempt to bypass its operation. Doing so makes the safety device inoperative and may result in personal injury through contact with the rotating blade. The blade control must operate easily in both directions and automatically return to the disengaged position when released.\n18. Never operate the mower in wet grass. Always be sure of your footing. A slip and fall can cause serious personal injury. If you feel you are losing your footing, release the blade control handle immediately and the blade will stop rotating within three seconds.\n19. Mow only in daylight or good artificial light. Walk, never run.\n20. Stop the blade when crossing gravel drives, walks or roads.\n21. If the equipment should start to vibrate abnormally, stop the engine and check immediately for the cause. Vibration is generally a warning of trouble.\n22. Shut the engine off and wait until the blade comes to a complete stop before removing the grass catcher or unclogging the chute. The cutting blade continues to rotate for a few seconds after the blade control is released. Never place any part of the body in the blade area until you are sure the blade has stopped rotating.\n23. Never operate mower without proper trail shield, discharge cover, grass catcher, blade control or other safety protective devices in place and working. Never operate mower with damaged safety devices. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.\n24. Muffler and engine become hot and can cause a burn. Do not touch.\n25. Never attempt to make a wheel or cutting height adjustment while the engine is running.\n26. Only use parts and accessories made for this machine by the manufacturer. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.",
            "27. When starting engine, pull cord slowly until resistance is felt, then pull rapidly. Rapid retraction of starter cord (kickback) will pull hand and arm toward engine faster than you can let go. Broken bones, fractures, bruises or sprains could result.\n28. If situations occur which are not covered in this manual, use care and good judgment. Contact Customer Support for assistance and the name of your nearest servicing dealer.",
            "### Children\n\nTragic accidents can occur if the operator is not alert to the presence of children. Children are often attracted to the mower and the mowing activity. They do not understand the dangers. Never assume that children will remain where you last saw them.\n\n1. Keep children out of the mowing area and under watchful care of a responsible adult other than the operator.\n2. Be alert and turn mower off if a child enters the area.\n3. Before and while moving backwards, look behind and down for small children.\n4. Use extreme care when approaching blind corners, doorways, shrubs, trees, or other objects that may block your vision of a child who may run into the mower.\n5. Keep children away from hot or running engines. They can suffer burns from a hot muffler.\n6. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and be trained and supervised by an adult.\n\n### Service\n\nSafe Handling of Gasoline\n\nTo avoid personal injury or property damage, use extreme care in handling gasoline. Gasoline is extremely flammable and the vapors are explosive. Serious personal injury can occur when gasoline is spilled on yourself or your clothes, which can ignite. Wash your skin and change clothes immediately.\n\n1. Use only an approved gasoline container.\n2. Never fill containers inside a vehicle or on a truck or trailer bed with a plastic liner. Always place containers on the ground away from your vehicle before filling.\n3. Remove gas-powered equipment from the truck or trailer and refuel it on the ground. If this is not possible, then refuel such equipment on a trailer with a portable container, rather than from a gasoline dispenser nozzle.\n4. Keep the nozzle in contact with the rim of the fuel tank or container opening at all times until fueling is complete. Do not use a nozzle lock-open device.\n5. Extinguish all cigarettes, cigars, pipes and other sources of ignition.\n6. Never fuel machine indoors because flammable vapors will accumulate in the area.\n7. Never remove gas cap or add fuel while the engine is hot or running. Allow engine to cool at least two minutes before refueling.\n8. Never overfill fuel tank. Fill tank to no more than \u00bd inch below bottom of filler neck to provide space for fuel expansion.\n9. Replace gasoline cap and tighten securely.\n10. If gasoline is spilled, wipe it off the engine and equipment. Move machine to another area. Wait 5 minutes before starting engine.\n11. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light (e.g. furnace, water heater, space heater, clothes dryer, etc.).\n12. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n13. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light such as a water heater, furnace, clothes dryer etc.\n14. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n\n---\n\n## General Service\n\n1. Never run an engine indoors or in a poorly ventilated area. Engine exhaust contains carbon monoxide, an odorless and deadly gas.\n2. Before cleaning, repairing, or inspecting, make certain the blade and all moving parts have stopped. Disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine to prevent unintended starting.\n3. Check the blade and engine mounting bolts at frequent intervals for proper tightness. Also, visually inspect blade for damage (e.g., bent, cracked, worn). Replace blade with the original equipment manufacturer\u2019s (O.E.M.) blade only, listed in this manual. \u201cUse of parts which do not meet the original equipment specifications may lead to improper performance and compromise safety!\u201d\n4. Mower blades are sharp and can cut. Wrap the blade or wear gloves, and use extra caution when servicing them.\n5. Keep all nuts, bolts, and screws tight to be sure the equipment is in safe working condition.\n6. Never tamper with safety devices. Check their proper operation regularly.\n7. After striking a foreign object, stop the engine, disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine. Thoroughly inspect the mower for any damage. Repair the damage before starting and operating the mower.\n8. Never attempt to make adjustments or repairs to the mower while the engine is running.\n9. Grass catcher components are subject to wear, damage and deterioration, which could expose moving parts or allow objects to be thrown. Frequently check components and replace with the manufacturer\u2019s recommended parts when necessary.\n10. Mower blades are sharp and can cut.

            "### DANGER\n\nThis machine was built to be operated according to the safe operation practices in this manual. As with any type of power equipment, carelessness or error on the part of the operator can result in serious injury. This machine is capable of amputating fingers, hands, toes and feet and throwing objects. Failure to observe the following safety instructions could result in serious injury or death.\n\n### General Operation",
            "1. Read this operator's manual carefully in its entirety before attempting to assemble this machine. Read, understand, and follow all instructions on the machine and in the manual(s) before operation. Keep this manual in a safe place for future and regular reference and for ordering replacement parts.\n2. Be completely familiar with the controls and the proper use of this machine before operating it.\n3. This machine is a precision piece of power equipment, not a plaything. Therefore, exercise extreme caution at all times. This machine has been designed to perform one job: to mow grass. Do not use it for any other purpose.\n4. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and should be trained and supervised by an adult.\n5. Only responsible individuals who are familiar with these rules of safe operation should be allowed to use this machine.\n6. Thoroughly inspect the area where the equipment is to be used. Remove all stones, sticks, wire, bones, toys and other foreign objects, which could be tripped over or picked up and thrown by the blade. Thrown objects can cause serious personal injury.\n7. Plan your mowing pattern to avoid discharge of material toward roads, sidewalks, bystanders and the like. Also, avoid discharging material against a wall or obstruction, which may cause discharged material to ricochet back toward the operator.\n8. To help avoid blade contact or a thrown object injury, stay in operator zone behind handles and keep children, bystanders, helpers and pets at least 75 feet from mower while it is in operation. Stop machine if anyone enters area.\n9. Always wear safety glasses or safety goggles during operation and while performing an adjustment or repair to protect your eyes. Thrown objects which ricochet can cause serious injury to the eyes.\n10. Wear sturdy, rough-soled work shoes and close-fitting slacks and shirts. Shirts and pants that cover the arms and legs and steel-toed shoes are recommended. Never operate this machine in bare feet, sandals, slippery or lightweight (e.g., canvas) shoes.\n11. Do not put hands or feet near rotating parts or under the cutting deck. Contact with blade can amputate fingers, hands, toes and feet.\n12. A missing or damaged discharge cover can cause blade contact or thrown object injuries.\n13. Many injuries occur as a result of the mower being pulled over the foot during a fall caused by slipping or tripping. Do not hold onto the mower if you are falling; release the handle immediately.\n14. Never pull the mower back toward you while you are walking. If you must back the mower away from a wall or obstruction first look down and behind to avoid tripping and then follow these steps:\n    - Step back from mower to fully extend your arms.\n    - Be sure you are well balanced with sure footing.\n    - Pull the mower back slowly, no more than halfway toward you.\n    - Repeat these steps as needed.\n15. Do not operate the mower while under the influence of alcohol or drugs.\n16. Do not engage the self-propelled mechanism on machines so equipped while starting engine.\n17. The blade control is a safety device. Never attempt to bypass its operation. Doing so makes the safety device inoperative and may result in personal injury through contact with the rotating blade. The blade control must operate easily in both directions and automatically return to the disengaged position when released.\n18. Never operate the mower in wet grass. Always be sure of your footing. A slip and fall can cause serious personal injury. If you feel you are losing your footing, release the blade control handle immediately and the blade will stop rotating within three seconds.\n19. Mow only in daylight or good artificial light. Walk, never run.\n20. Stop the blade when crossing gravel drives, walks or roads.\n21. If the equipment should start to vibrate abnormally, stop the engine and check immediately for the cause. Vibration is generally a warning of trouble.\n22. Shut the engine off and wait until the blade comes to a complete stop before removing the grass catcher or unclogging the chute. The cutting blade continues to rotate for a few seconds after the blade control is released. Never place any part of the body in the blade area until you are sure the blade has stopped rotating.\n23. Never operate mower without proper trail shield, discharge cover, grass catcher, blade control or other safety protective devices in place and working. Never operate mower with damaged safety devices. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.\n24. Muffler and engine become hot and can cause a burn. Do not touch.\n25. Never attempt to make a wheel or cutting height adjustment while the engine is running.\n26. Only use parts and accessories made for this machine by the manufacturer. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.",
            "27. When starting engine, pull cord slowly until resistance is felt, then pull rapidly. Rapid retraction of starter cord (kickback) will pull hand and arm toward engine faster than you can let go. Broken bones, fractures, bruises or sprains could result.\n28. If situations occur which are not covered in this manual, use care and good judgment. Contact Customer Support for assistance and the name of your nearest servicing dealer.",
            "### Children\n\nTragic accidents can occur if the operator is not alert to the presence of children. Children are often attracted to the mower and the mowing activity. They do not understand the dangers. Never assume that children will remain where you last saw them.\n\n1. Keep children out of the mowing area and under watchful care of a responsible adult other than the operator.\n2. Be alert and turn mower off if a child enters the area.\n3. Before and while moving backwards, look behind and down for small children.\n4. Use extreme care when approaching blind corners, doorways, shrubs, trees, or other objects that may block your vision of a child who may run into the mower.\n5. Keep children away from hot or running engines. They can suffer burns from a hot muffler.\n6. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and be trained and supervised by an adult.\n\n### Service\n\nSafe Handling of Gasoline\n\nTo avoid personal injury or property damage, use extreme care in handling gasoline. Gasoline is extremely flammable and the vapors are explosive. Serious personal injury can occur when gasoline is spilled on yourself or your clothes, which can ignite. Wash your skin and change clothes immediately.\n\n1. Use only an approved gasoline container.\n2. Never fill containers inside a vehicle or on a truck or trailer bed with a plastic liner. Always place containers on the ground away from your vehicle before filling.\n3. Remove gas-powered equipment from the truck or trailer and refuel it on the ground. If this is not possible, then refuel such equipment on a trailer with a portable container, rather than from a gasoline dispenser nozzle.\n4. Keep the nozzle in contact with the rim of the fuel tank or container opening at all times until fueling is complete. Do not use a nozzle lock-open device.\n5. Extinguish all cigarettes, cigars, pipes and other sources of ignition.\n6. Never fuel machine indoors because flammable vapors will accumulate in the area.\n7. Never remove gas cap or add fuel while the engine is hot or running. Allow engine to cool at least two minutes before refueling.\n8. Never overfill fuel tank. Fill tank to no more than \u00bd inch below bottom of filler neck to provide space for fuel expansion.\n9. Replace gasoline cap and tighten securely.\n10. If gasoline is spilled, wipe it off the engine and equipment. Move machine to another area. Wait 5 minutes before starting engine.\n11. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light (e.g. furnace, water heater, space heater, clothes dryer, etc.).\n12. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n13. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light such as a water heater, furnace, clothes dryer etc.\n14. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n\n---\n\n## General Service\n\n1. Never run an engine indoors or in a poorly ventilated area. Engine exhaust contains carbon monoxide, an odorless and deadly gas.\n2. Before cleaning, repairing, or inspecting, make certain the blade and all moving parts have stopped. Disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine to prevent unintended starting.\n3. Check the blade and engine mounting bolts at frequent intervals for proper tightness. Also, visually inspect blade for damage (e.g., bent, cracked, worn). Replace blade with the original equipment manufacturer\u2019s (O.E.M.) blade only, listed in this manual. \u201cUse of parts which do not meet the original equipment specifications may lead to improper performance and compromise safety!\u201d\n4. Mower blades are sharp and can cut. Wrap the blade or wear gloves, and use extra caution when servicing them.\n5. Keep all nuts, bolts, and screws tight to be sure the equipment is in safe working condition.\n6. Never tamper with safety devices. Check their proper operation regularly.\n7. After striking a foreign object, stop the engine, disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine. Thoroughly inspect the mower for any damage. Repair the damage before starting and operating the mower.\n8. Never attempt to make adjustments or repairs to the mower while the engine is running.\n9. Grass catcher components are subject to wear, damage and deterioration, which could expose moving parts or allow objects to be thrown. Frequently check components and replace with the manufacturer\u2019s recommended parts when necessary.\n10. Mower blades are sharp and can cut.

            "### DANGER\n\nThis machine was built to be operated according to the safe operation practices in this manual. As with any type of power equipment, carelessness or error on the part of the operator can result in serious injury. This machine is capable of amputating fingers, hands, toes and feet and throwing objects. Failure to observe the following safety instructions could result in serious injury or death.\n\n### General Operation",
            "1. Read this operator's manual carefully in its entirety before attempting to assemble this machine. Read, understand, and follow all instructions on the machine and in the manual(s) before operation. Keep this manual in a safe place for future and regular reference and for ordering replacement parts.\n2. Be completely familiar with the controls and the proper use of this machine before operating it.\n3. This machine is a precision piece of power equipment, not a plaything. Therefore, exercise extreme caution at all times. This machine has been designed to perform one job: to mow grass. Do not use it for any other purpose.\n4. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and should be trained and supervised by an adult.\n5. Only responsible individuals who are familiar with these rules of safe operation should be allowed to use this machine.\n6. Thoroughly inspect the area where the equipment is to be used. Remove all stones, sticks, wire, bones, toys and other foreign objects, which could be tripped over or picked up and thrown by the blade. Thrown objects can cause serious personal injury.\n7. Plan your mowing pattern to avoid discharge of material toward roads, sidewalks, bystanders and the like. Also, avoid discharging material against a wall or obstruction, which may cause discharged material to ricochet back toward the operator.\n8. To help avoid blade contact or a thrown object injury, stay in operator zone behind handles and keep children, bystanders, helpers and pets at least 75 feet from mower while it is in operation. Stop machine if anyone enters area.\n9. Always wear safety glasses or safety goggles during operation and while performing an adjustment or repair to protect your eyes. Thrown objects which ricochet can cause serious injury to the eyes.\n10. Wear sturdy, rough-soled work shoes and close-fitting slacks and shirts. Shirts and pants that cover the arms and legs and steel-toed shoes are recommended. Never operate this machine in bare feet, sandals, slippery or lightweight (e.g., canvas) shoes.\n11. Do not put hands or feet near rotating parts or under the cutting deck. Contact with blade can amputate fingers, hands, toes and feet.\n12. A missing or damaged discharge cover can cause blade contact or thrown object injuries.\n13. Many injuries occur as a result of the mower being pulled over the foot during a fall caused by slipping or tripping. Do not hold onto the mower if you are falling; release the handle immediately.\n14. Never pull the mower back toward you while you are walking. If you must back the mower away from a wall or obstruction first look down and behind to avoid tripping and then follow these steps:\n    - Step back from mower to fully extend your arms.\n    - Be sure you are well balanced with sure footing.\n    - Pull the mower back slowly, no more than halfway toward you.\n    - Repeat these steps as needed.\n15. Do not operate the mower while under the influence of alcohol or drugs.\n16. Do not engage the self-propelled mechanism on machines so equipped while starting engine.\n17. The blade control is a safety device. Never attempt to bypass its operation. Doing so makes the safety device inoperative and may result in personal injury through contact with the rotating blade. The blade control must operate easily in both directions and automatically return to the disengaged position when released.\n18. Never operate the mower in wet grass. Always be sure of your footing. A slip and fall can cause serious personal injury. If you feel you are losing your footing, release the blade control handle immediately and the blade will stop rotating within three seconds.\n19. Mow only in daylight or good artificial light. Walk, never run.\n20. Stop the blade when crossing gravel drives, walks or roads.\n21. If the equipment should start to vibrate abnormally, stop the engine and check immediately for the cause. Vibration is generally a warning of trouble.\n22. Shut the engine off and wait until the blade comes to a complete stop before removing the grass catcher or unclogging the chute. The cutting blade continues to rotate for a few seconds after the blade control is released. Never place any part of the body in the blade area until you are sure the blade has stopped rotating.\n23. Never operate mower without proper trail shield, discharge cover, grass catcher, blade control or other safety protective devices in place and working. Never operate mower with damaged safety devices. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.\n24. Muffler and engine become hot and can cause a burn. Do not touch.\n25. Never attempt to make a wheel or cutting height adjustment while the engine is running.\n26. Only use parts and accessories made for this machine by the manufacturer. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.",
            "27. When starting engine, pull cord slowly until resistance is felt, then pull rapidly. Rapid retraction of starter cord (kickback) will pull hand and arm toward engine faster than you can let go. Broken bones, fractures, bruises or sprains could result.\n28. If situations occur which are not covered in this manual, use care and good judgment. Contact Customer Support for assistance and the name of your nearest servicing dealer.",
            "### Children\n\nTragic accidents can occur if the operator is not alert to the presence of children. Children are often attracted to the mower and the mowing activity. They do not understand the dangers. Never assume that children will remain where you last saw them.\n\n1. Keep children out of the mowing area and under watchful care of a responsible adult other than the operator.\n2. Be alert and turn mower off if a child enters the area.\n3. Before and while moving backwards, look behind and down for small children.\n4. Use extreme care when approaching blind corners, doorways, shrubs, trees, or other objects that may block your vision of a child who may run into the mower.\n5. Keep children away from hot or running engines. They can suffer burns from a hot muffler.\n6. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and be trained and supervised by an adult.\n\n### Service\n\nSafe Handling of Gasoline\n\nTo avoid personal injury or property damage, use extreme care in handling gasoline. Gasoline is extremely flammable and the vapors are explosive. Serious personal injury can occur when gasoline is spilled on yourself or your clothes, which can ignite. Wash your skin and change clothes immediately.\n\n1. Use only an approved gasoline container.\n2. Never fill containers inside a vehicle or on a truck or trailer bed with a plastic liner. Always place containers on the ground away from your vehicle before filling.\n3. Remove gas-powered equipment from the truck or trailer and refuel it on the ground. If this is not possible, then refuel such equipment on a trailer with a portable container, rather than from a gasoline dispenser nozzle.\n4. Keep the nozzle in contact with the rim of the fuel tank or container opening at all times until fueling is complete. Do not use a nozzle lock-open device.\n5. Extinguish all cigarettes, cigars, pipes and other sources of ignition.\n6. Never fuel machine indoors because flammable vapors will accumulate in the area.\n7. Never remove gas cap or add fuel while the engine is hot or running. Allow engine to cool at least two minutes before refueling.\n8. Never overfill fuel tank. Fill tank to no more than \u00bd inch below bottom of filler neck to provide space for fuel expansion.\n9. Replace gasoline cap and tighten securely.\n10. If gasoline is spilled, wipe it off the engine and equipment. Move machine to another area. Wait 5 minutes before starting engine.\n11. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light (e.g. furnace, water heater, space heater, clothes dryer, etc.).\n12. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n13. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light such as a water heater, furnace, clothes dryer etc.\n14. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n\n---\n\n## General Service\n\n1. Never run an engine indoors or in a poorly ventilated area. Engine exhaust contains carbon monoxide, an odorless and deadly gas.\n2. Before cleaning, repairing, or inspecting, make certain the blade and all moving parts have stopped. Disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine to prevent unintended starting.\n3. Check the blade and engine mounting bolts at frequent intervals for proper tightness. Also, visually inspect blade for damage (e.g., bent, cracked, worn). Replace blade with the original equipment manufacturer\u2019s (O.E.M.) blade only, listed in this manual. \u201cUse of parts which do not meet the original equipment specifications may lead to improper performance and compromise safety!\u201d\n4. Mower blades are sharp and can cut. Wrap the blade or wear gloves, and use extra caution when servicing them.\n5. Keep all nuts, bolts, and screws tight to be sure the equipment is in safe working condition.\n6. Never tamper with safety devices. Check their proper operation regularly.\n7. After striking a foreign object, stop the engine, disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine. Thoroughly inspect the mower for any damage. Repair the damage before starting and operating the mower.\n8. Never attempt to make adjustments or repairs to the mower while the engine is running.\n9. Grass catcher components are subject to wear, damage and deterioration, which could expose moving parts or allow objects to be thrown. Frequently check components and replace with the manufacturer\u2019s recommended parts when necessary.\n10. Mower blades are sharp and can cut. Wrap the blade or wear gloves, and use extra caution when servicing them.\n11. Do not change the engine governor setting or over-speed the engine.

            "### DANGER\n\nThis machine was built to be operated according to the safe operation practices in this manual. As with any type of power equipment, carelessness or error on the part of the operator can result in serious injury. This machine is capable of amputating fingers, hands, toes and feet and throwing objects. Failure to observe the following safety instructions could result in serious injury or death.\n\n### General Operation",
            "1. Read this operator's manual carefully in its entirety before attempting to assemble this machine. Read, understand, and follow all instructions on the machine and in the manual(s) before operation. Keep this manual in a safe place for future and regular reference and for ordering replacement parts.\n2. Be completely familiar with the controls and the proper use of this machine before operating it.\n3. This machine is a precision piece of power equipment, not a plaything. Therefore, exercise extreme caution at all times. This machine has been designed to perform one job: to mow grass. Do not use it for any other purpose.\n4. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and should be trained and supervised by an adult.\n5. Only responsible individuals who are familiar with these rules of safe operation should be allowed to use this machine.\n6. Thoroughly inspect the area where the equipment is to be used. Remove all stones, sticks, wire, bones, toys and other foreign objects, which could be tripped over or picked up and thrown by the blade. Thrown objects can cause serious personal injury.\n7. Plan your mowing pattern to avoid discharge of material toward roads, sidewalks, bystanders and the like. Also, avoid discharging material against a wall or obstruction, which may cause discharged material to ricochet back toward the operator.\n8. To help avoid blade contact or a thrown object injury, stay in operator zone behind handles and keep children, bystanders, helpers and pets at least 75 feet from mower while it is in operation. Stop machine if anyone enters area.\n9. Always wear safety glasses or safety goggles during operation and while performing an adjustment or repair to protect your eyes. Thrown objects which ricochet can cause serious injury to the eyes.\n10. Wear sturdy, rough-soled work shoes and close-fitting slacks and shirts. Shirts and pants that cover the arms and legs and steel-toed shoes are recommended. Never operate this machine in bare feet, sandals, slippery or lightweight (e.g., canvas) shoes.\n11. Do not put hands or feet near rotating parts or under the cutting deck. Contact with blade can amputate fingers, hands, toes and feet.\n12. A missing or damaged discharge cover can cause blade contact or thrown object injuries.\n13. Many injuries occur as a result of the mower being pulled over the foot during a fall caused by slipping or tripping. Do not hold onto the mower if you are falling; release the handle immediately.\n14. Never pull the mower back toward you while you are walking. If you must back the mower away from a wall or obstruction first look down and behind to avoid tripping and then follow these steps:\n    - Step back from mower to fully extend your arms.\n    - Be sure you are well balanced with sure footing.\n    - Pull the mower back slowly, no more than halfway toward you.\n    - Repeat these steps as needed.\n15. Do not operate the mower while under the influence of alcohol or drugs.\n16. Do not engage the self-propelled mechanism on machines so equipped while starting engine.\n17. The blade control is a safety device. Never attempt to bypass its operation. Doing so makes the safety device inoperative and may result in personal injury through contact with the rotating blade. The blade control must operate easily in both directions and automatically return to the disengaged position when released.\n18. Never operate the mower in wet grass. Always be sure of your footing. A slip and fall can cause serious personal injury. If you feel you are losing your footing, release the blade control handle immediately and the blade will stop rotating within three seconds.\n19. Mow only in daylight or good artificial light. Walk, never run.\n20. Stop the blade when crossing gravel drives, walks or roads.\n21. If the equipment should start to vibrate abnormally, stop the engine and check immediately for the cause. Vibration is generally a warning of trouble.\n22. Shut the engine off and wait until the blade comes to a complete stop before removing the grass catcher or unclogging the chute. The cutting blade continues to rotate for a few seconds after the blade control is released. Never place any part of the body in the blade area until you are sure the blade has stopped rotating.\n23. Never operate mower without proper trail shield, discharge cover, grass catcher, blade control or other safety protective devices in place and working. Never operate mower with damaged safety devices. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.\n24. Muffler and engine become hot and can cause a burn. Do not touch.\n25. Never attempt to make a wheel or cutting height adjustment while the engine is running.\n26. Only use parts and accessories made for this machine by the manufacturer. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.",
            "27. When starting engine, pull cord slowly until resistance is felt, then pull rapidly. Rapid retraction of starter cord (kickback) will pull hand and arm toward engine faster than you can let go. Broken bones, fractures, bruises or sprains could result.\n28. If situations occur which are not covered in this manual, use care and good judgment. Contact Customer Support for assistance and the name of your nearest servicing dealer.",
            "### Children\n\nTragic accidents can occur if the operator is not alert to the presence of children. Children are often attracted to the mower and the mowing activity. They do not understand the dangers. Never assume that children will remain where you last saw them.\n\n1. Keep children out of the mowing area and under watchful care of a responsible adult other than the operator.\n2. Be alert and turn mower off if a child enters the area.\n3. Before and while moving backwards, look behind and down for small children.\n4. Use extreme care when approaching blind corners, doorways, shrubs, trees, or other objects that may block your vision of a child who may run into the mower.\n5. Keep children away from hot or running engines. They can suffer burns from a hot muffler.\n6. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and be trained and supervised by an adult.\n\n### Service\n\nSafe Handling of Gasoline\n\nTo avoid personal injury or property damage, use extreme care in handling gasoline. Gasoline is extremely flammable and the vapors are explosive. Serious personal injury can occur when gasoline is spilled on yourself or your clothes, which can ignite. Wash your skin and change clothes immediately.\n\n1. Use only an approved gasoline container.\n2. Never fill containers inside a vehicle or on a truck or trailer bed with a plastic liner. Always place containers on the ground away from your vehicle before filling.\n3. Remove gas-powered equipment from the truck or trailer and refuel it on the ground. If this is not possible, then refuel such equipment on a trailer with a portable container, rather than from a gasoline dispenser nozzle.\n4. Keep the nozzle in contact with the rim of the fuel tank or container opening at all times until fueling is complete. Do not use a nozzle lock-open device.\n5. Extinguish all cigarettes, cigars, pipes and other sources of ignition.\n6. Never fuel machine indoors because flammable vapors will accumulate in the area.\n7. Never remove gas cap or add fuel while the engine is hot or running. Allow engine to cool at least two minutes before refueling.\n8. Never overfill fuel tank. Fill tank to no more than \u00bd inch below bottom of filler neck to provide space for fuel expansion.\n9. Replace gasoline cap and tighten securely.\n10. If gasoline is spilled, wipe it off the engine and equipment. Move machine to another area. Wait 5 minutes before starting engine.\n11. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light (e.g. furnace, water heater, space heater, clothes dryer, etc.).\n12. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n13. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light such as a water heater, furnace, clothes dryer etc.\n14. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n\n---\n\n## General Service\n\n1. Never run an engine indoors or in a poorly ventilated area. Engine exhaust contains carbon monoxide, an odorless and deadly gas.\n2. Before cleaning, repairing, or inspecting, make certain the blade and all moving parts have stopped. Disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine to prevent unintended starting.\n3. Check the blade and engine mounting bolts at frequent intervals for proper tightness. Also, visually inspect blade for damage (e.g., bent, cracked, worn). Replace blade with the original equipment manufacturer\u2019s (O.E.M.) blade only, listed in this manual. \u201cUse of parts which do not meet the original equipment specifications may lead to improper performance and compromise safety!\u201d\n4. Mower blades are sharp and can cut. Wrap the blade or wear gloves, and use extra caution when servicing them.\n5. Keep all nuts, bolts, and screws tight to be sure the equipment is in safe working condition.\n6. Never tamper with safety devices. Check their proper operation regularly.\n7. After striking a foreign object, stop the engine, disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine. Thoroughly inspect the mower for any damage. Repair the damage before starting and operating the mower.\n8. Never attempt to make adjustments or repairs to the mower while the engine is running.\n9. Grass catcher components are subject to wear, damage and deterioration, which could expose moving parts or allow objects to be thrown. Frequently check components and replace with the manufacturer\u2019s recommended parts when necessary.\n10. Mower blades are sharp and can cut.

            "### DANGER\n\nThis machine was built to be operated according to the safe operation practices in this manual. As with any type of power equipment, carelessness or error on the part of the operator can result in serious injury. This machine is capable of amputating fingers, hands, toes and feet and throwing objects. Failure to observe the following safety instructions could result in serious injury or death.\n\n### General Operation",
            "1. Read this operator's manual carefully in its entirety before attempting to assemble this machine. Read, understand, and follow all instructions on the machine and in the manual(s) before operation. Keep this manual in a safe place for future and regular reference and for ordering replacement parts.\n2. Be completely familiar with the controls and the proper use of this machine before operating it.\n3. This machine is a precision piece of power equipment, not a plaything. Therefore, exercise extreme caution at all times. This machine has been designed to perform one job: to mow grass. Do not use it for any other purpose.\n4. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and should be trained and supervised by an adult.\n5. Only responsible individuals who are familiar with these rules of safe operation should be allowed to use this machine.\n6. Thoroughly inspect the area where the equipment is to be used. Remove all stones, sticks, wire, bones, toys and other foreign objects, which could be tripped over or picked up and thrown by the blade. Thrown objects can cause serious personal injury.\n7. Plan your mowing pattern to avoid discharge of material toward roads, sidewalks, bystanders and the like. Also, avoid discharging material against a wall or obstruction, which may cause discharged material to ricochet back toward the operator.\n8. To help avoid blade contact or a thrown object injury, stay in operator zone behind handles and keep children, bystanders, helpers and pets at least 75 feet from mower while it is in operation. Stop machine if anyone enters area.\n9. Always wear safety glasses or safety goggles during operation and while performing an adjustment or repair to protect your eyes. Thrown objects which ricochet can cause serious injury to the eyes.\n10. Wear sturdy, rough-soled work shoes and close-fitting slacks and shirts. Shirts and pants that cover the arms and legs and steel-toed shoes are recommended. Never operate this machine in bare feet, sandals, slippery or lightweight (e.g., canvas) shoes.\n11. Do not put hands or feet near rotating parts or under the cutting deck. Contact with blade can amputate fingers, hands, toes and feet.\n12. A missing or damaged discharge cover can cause blade contact or thrown object injuries.\n13. Many injuries occur as a result of the mower being pulled over the foot during a fall caused by slipping or tripping. Do not hold onto the mower if you are falling; release the handle immediately.\n14. Never pull the mower back toward you while you are walking. If you must back the mower away from a wall or obstruction first look down and behind to avoid tripping and then follow these steps:\n    - Step back from mower to fully extend your arms.\n    - Be sure you are well balanced with sure footing.\n    - Pull the mower back slowly, no more than halfway toward you.\n    - Repeat these steps as needed.\n15. Do not operate the mower while under the influence of alcohol or drugs.\n16. Do not engage the self-propelled mechanism on machines so equipped while starting engine.\n17. The blade control is a safety device. Never attempt to bypass its operation. Doing so makes the safety device inoperative and may result in personal injury through contact with the rotating blade. The blade control must operate easily in both directions and automatically return to the disengaged position when released.\n18. Never operate the mower in wet grass. Always be sure of your footing. A slip and fall can cause serious personal injury. If you feel you are losing your footing, release the blade control handle immediately and the blade will stop rotating within three seconds.\n19. Mow only in daylight or good artificial light. Walk, never run.\n20. Stop the blade when crossing gravel drives, walks or roads.\n21. If the equipment should start to vibrate abnormally, stop the engine and check immediately for the cause. Vibration is generally a warning of trouble.\n22. Shut the engine off and wait until the blade comes to a complete stop before removing the grass catcher or unclogging the chute. The cutting blade continues to rotate for a few seconds after the blade control is released. Never place any part of the body in the blade area until you are sure the blade has stopped rotating.\n23. Never operate mower without proper trail shield, discharge cover, grass catcher, blade control or other safety protective devices in place and working. Never operate mower with damaged safety devices. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.\n24. Muffler and engine become hot and can cause a burn. Do not touch.\n25. Never attempt to make a wheel or cutting height adjustment while the engine is running.\n26. Only use parts and accessories made for this machine by the manufacturer. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.",
            "27. When starting engine, pull cord slowly until resistance is felt, then pull rapidly. Rapid retraction of starter cord (kickback) will pull hand and arm toward engine faster than you can let go. Broken bones, fractures, bruises or sprains could result.\n28. If situations occur which are not covered in this manual, use care and good judgment. Contact Customer Support for assistance and the name of your nearest servicing dealer.",
            "### Children\n\nTragic accidents can occur if the operator is not alert to the presence of children. Children are often attracted to the mower and the mowing activity. They do not understand the dangers. Never assume that children will remain where you last saw them.\n\n1. Keep children out of the mowing area and under watchful care of a responsible adult other than the operator.\n2. Be alert and turn mower off if a child enters the area.\n3. Before and while moving backwards, look behind and down for small children.\n4. Use extreme care when approaching blind corners, doorways, shrubs, trees, or other objects that may block your vision of a child who may run into the mower.\n5. Keep children away from hot or running engines. They can suffer burns from a hot muffler.\n6. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and be trained and supervised by an adult.\n\n### Service\n\nSafe Handling of Gasoline\n\nTo avoid personal injury or property damage, use extreme care in handling gasoline. Gasoline is extremely flammable and the vapors are explosive. Serious personal injury can occur when gasoline is spilled on yourself or your clothes, which can ignite. Wash your skin and change clothes immediately.\n\n1. Use only an approved gasoline container.\n2. Never fill containers inside a vehicle or on a truck or trailer bed with a plastic liner. Always place containers on the ground away from your vehicle before filling.\n3. Remove gas-powered equipment from the truck or trailer and refuel it on the ground. If this is not possible, then refuel such equipment on a trailer with a portable container, rather than from a gasoline dispenser nozzle.\n4. Keep the nozzle in contact with the rim of the fuel tank or container opening at all times until fueling is complete. Do not use a nozzle lock-open device.\n5. Extinguish all cigarettes, cigars, pipes and other sources of ignition.\n6. Never fuel machine indoors because flammable vapors will accumulate in the area.\n7. Never remove gas cap or add fuel while the engine is hot or running. Allow engine to cool at least two minutes before refueling.\n8. Never overfill fuel tank. Fill tank to no more than \u00bd inch below bottom of filler neck to provide space for fuel expansion.\n9. Replace gasoline cap and tighten securely.\n10. If gasoline is spilled, wipe it off the engine and equipment. Move machine to another area. Wait 5 minutes before starting engine.\n11. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light (e.g. furnace, water heater, space heater, clothes dryer, etc.).\n12. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n13. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light such as a water heater, furnace, clothes dryer etc.\n14. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n\n---\n\n## General Service\n\n1. Never run an engine indoors or in a poorly ventilated area. Engine exhaust contains carbon monoxide, an odorless and deadly gas.\n2. Before cleaning, repairing, or inspecting, make certain the blade and all moving parts have stopped. Disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine to prevent unintended starting.\n3. Check the blade and engine mounting bolts at frequent intervals for proper tightness. Also, visually inspect blade for damage (e.g., bent, cracked, worn). Replace blade with the original equipment manufacturer\u2019s (O.E.M.) blade only, listed in this manual. \u201cUse of parts which do not meet the original equipment specifications may lead to improper performance and compromise safety!\u201d\n4. Mower blades are sharp and can cut. Wrap the blade or wear gloves, and use extra caution when servicing them.\n5. Keep all nuts, bolts, and screws tight to be sure the equipment is in safe working condition.\n6. Never tamper with safety devices. Check their proper operation regularly.\n7. After striking a foreign object, stop the engine, disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine. Thoroughly inspect the mower for any damage. Repair the damage before starting and operating the mower.\n8. Never attempt to make adjustments or repairs to the mower while the engine is running.\n9. Grass catcher components are subject to wear, damage and deterioration, which could expose moving parts or allow objects to be thrown. Frequently check components and replace with the manufacturer\u2019s recommended parts when necessary.\n10. Mower blades are sharp and can cut.

            "### DANGER\n\nThis machine was built to be operated according to the safe operation practices in this manual. As with any type of power equipment, carelessness or error on the part of the operator can result in serious injury. This machine is capable of amputating fingers, hands, toes and feet and throwing objects. Failure to observe the following safety instructions could result in serious injury or death.\n\n### General Operation",
            "1. Read this operator's manual carefully in its entirety before attempting to assemble this machine. Read, understand, and follow all instructions on the machine and in the manual(s) before operation. Keep this manual in a safe place for future and regular reference and for ordering replacement parts.\n2. Be completely familiar with the controls and the proper use of this machine before operating it.\n3. This machine is a precision piece of power equipment, not a plaything. Therefore, exercise extreme caution at all times. This machine has been designed to perform one job: to mow grass. Do not use it for any other purpose.\n4. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and should be trained and supervised by an adult.\n5. Only responsible individuals who are familiar with these rules of safe operation should be allowed to use this machine.\n6. Thoroughly inspect the area where the equipment is to be used. Remove all stones, sticks, wire, bones, toys and other foreign objects, which could be tripped over or picked up and thrown by the blade. Thrown objects can cause serious personal injury.\n7. Plan your mowing pattern to avoid discharge of material toward roads, sidewalks, bystanders and the like. Also, avoid discharging material against a wall or obstruction, which may cause discharged material to ricochet back toward the operator.\n8. To help avoid blade contact or a thrown object injury, stay in operator zone behind handles and keep children, bystanders, helpers and pets at least 75 feet from mower while it is in operation. Stop machine if anyone enters area.\n9. Always wear safety glasses or safety goggles during operation and while performing an adjustment or repair to protect your eyes. Thrown objects which ricochet can cause serious injury to the eyes.\n10. Wear sturdy, rough-soled work shoes and close-fitting slacks and shirts. Shirts and pants that cover the arms and legs and steel-toed shoes are recommended. Never operate this machine in bare feet, sandals, slippery or lightweight (e.g., canvas) shoes.\n11. Do not put hands or feet near rotating parts or under the cutting deck. Contact with blade can amputate fingers, hands, toes and feet.\n12. A missing or damaged discharge cover can cause blade contact or thrown object injuries.\n13. Many injuries occur as a result of the mower being pulled over the foot during a fall caused by slipping or tripping. Do not hold onto the mower if you are falling; release the handle immediately.\n14. Never pull the mower back toward you while you are walking. If you must back the mower away from a wall or obstruction first look down and behind to avoid tripping and then follow these steps:\n    - Step back from mower to fully extend your arms.\n    - Be sure you are well balanced with sure footing.\n    - Pull the mower back slowly, no more than halfway toward you.\n    - Repeat these steps as needed.\n15. Do not operate the mower while under the influence of alcohol or drugs.\n16. Do not engage the self-propelled mechanism on machines so equipped while starting engine.\n17. The blade control is a safety device. Never attempt to bypass its operation. Doing so makes the safety device inoperative and may result in personal injury through contact with the rotating blade. The blade control must operate easily in both directions and automatically return to the disengaged position when released.\n18. Never operate the mower in wet grass. Always be sure of your footing. A slip and fall can cause serious personal injury. If you feel you are losing your footing, release the blade control handle immediately and the blade will stop rotating within three seconds.\n19. Mow only in daylight or good artificial light. Walk, never run.\n20. Stop the blade when crossing gravel drives, walks or roads.\n21. If the equipment should start to vibrate abnormally, stop the engine and check immediately for the cause. Vibration is generally a warning of trouble.\n22. Shut the engine off and wait until the blade comes to a complete stop before removing the grass catcher or unclogging the chute. The cutting blade continues to rotate for a few seconds after the blade control is released. Never place any part of the body in the blade area until you are sure the blade has stopped rotating.\n23. Never operate mower without proper trail shield, discharge cover, grass catcher, blade control or other safety protective devices in place and working. Never operate mower with damaged safety devices. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.\n24. Muffler and engine become hot and can cause a burn. Do not touch.\n25. Never attempt to make a wheel or cutting height adjustment while the engine is running.\n26. Only use parts and accessories made for this machine by the manufacturer. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.",
            "27. When starting engine, pull cord slowly until resistance is felt, then pull rapidly. Rapid retraction of starter cord (kickback) will pull hand and arm toward engine faster than you can let go. Broken bones, fractures, bruises or sprains could result.\n28. If situations occur which are not covered in this manual, use care and good judgment. Contact Customer Support for assistance and the name of your nearest servicing dealer.",
            "### Children\n\nTragic accidents can occur if the operator is not alert to the presence of children. Children are often attracted to the mower and the mowing activity. They do not understand the dangers. Never assume that children will remain where you last saw them.\n\n1. Keep children out of the mowing area and under watchful care of a responsible adult other than the operator.\n2. Be alert and turn mower off if a child enters the area.\n3. Before and while moving backwards, look behind and down for small children.\n4. Use extreme care when approaching blind corners, doorways, shrubs, trees, or other objects that may block your vision of a child who may run into the mower.\n5. Keep children away from hot or running engines. They can suffer burns from a hot muffler.\n6. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and be trained and supervised by an adult.\n\n### Service\n\nSafe Handling of Gasoline\n\nTo avoid personal injury or property damage, use extreme care in handling gasoline. Gasoline is extremely flammable and the vapors are explosive. Serious personal injury can occur when gasoline is spilled on yourself or your clothes, which can ignite. Wash your skin and change clothes immediately.\n\n1. Use only an approved gasoline container.\n2. Never fill containers inside a vehicle or on a truck or trailer bed with a plastic liner. Always place containers on the ground away from your vehicle before filling.\n3. Remove gas-powered equipment from the truck or trailer and refuel it on the ground. If this is not possible, then refuel such equipment on a trailer with a portable container, rather than from a gasoline dispenser nozzle.\n4. Keep the nozzle in contact with the rim of the fuel tank or container opening at all times until fueling is complete. Do not use a nozzle lock-open device.\n5. Extinguish all cigarettes, cigars, pipes and other sources of ignition.\n6. Never fuel machine indoors because flammable vapors will accumulate in the area.\n7. Never remove gas cap or add fuel while the engine is hot or running. Allow engine to cool at least two minutes before refueling.\n8. Never overfill fuel tank. Fill tank to no more than \u00bd inch below bottom of filler neck to provide space for fuel expansion.\n9. Replace gasoline cap and tighten securely.\n10. If gasoline is spilled, wipe it off the engine and equipment. Move machine to another area. Wait 5 minutes before starting engine.\n11. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light (e.g. furnace, water heater, space heater, clothes dryer, etc.).\n12. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n13. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light such as a water heater, furnace, clothes dryer etc.\n14. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n\n---\n\n## General Service\n\n1. Never run an engine indoors or in a poorly ventilated area. Engine exhaust contains carbon monoxide, an odorless and deadly gas.\n2. Before cleaning, repairing, or inspecting, make certain the blade and all moving parts have stopped. Disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine to prevent unintended starting.\n3. Check the blade and engine mounting bolts at frequent intervals for proper tightness. Also, visually inspect blade for damage (e.g., bent, cracked, worn). Replace blade with the original equipment manufacturer\u2019s (O.E.M.) blade only, listed in this manual. \u201cUse of parts which do not meet the original equipment specifications may lead to improper performance and compromise safety!\u201d\n4. Mower blades are sharp and can cut. Wrap the blade or wear gloves, and use extra caution when servicing them.\n5. Keep all nuts, bolts, and screws tight to be sure the equipment is in safe working condition.\n6. Never tamper with safety devices. Check their proper operation regularly.\n7. After striking a foreign object, stop the engine, disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine. Thoroughly inspect the mower for any damage. Repair the damage before starting and operating the mower.\n8. Never attempt to make adjustments or repairs to the mower while the engine is running.\n9. Grass catcher components are subject to wear, damage and deterioration, which could expose moving parts or allow objects to be thrown. Frequently check components and replace with the manufacturer\u2019s recommended parts when necessary.\n10. Mower blades are sharp and can cut.

            "### DANGER\n\nThis machine was built to be operated according to the safe operation practices in this manual. As with any type of power equipment, carelessness or error on the part of the operator can result in serious injury. This machine is capable of amputating fingers, hands, toes and feet and throwing objects. Failure to observe the following safety instructions could result in serious injury or death.\n\n### General Operation",
            "1. Read this operator's manual carefully in its entirety before attempting to assemble this machine. Read, understand, and follow all instructions on the machine and in the manual(s) before operation. Keep this manual in a safe place for future and regular reference and for ordering replacement parts.\n2. Be completely familiar with the controls and the proper use of this machine before operating it.\n3. This machine is a precision piece of power equipment, not a plaything. Therefore, exercise extreme caution at all times. This machine has been designed to perform one job: to mow grass. Do not use it for any other purpose.\n4. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and should be trained and supervised by an adult.\n5. Only responsible individuals who are familiar with these rules of safe operation should be allowed to use this machine.\n6. Thoroughly inspect the area where the equipment is to be used. Remove all stones, sticks, wire, bones, toys and other foreign objects, which could be tripped over or picked up and thrown by the blade. Thrown objects can cause serious personal injury.\n7. Plan your mowing pattern to avoid discharge of material toward roads, sidewalks, bystanders and the like. Also, avoid discharging material against a wall or obstruction, which may cause discharged material to ricochet back toward the operator.\n8. To help avoid blade contact or a thrown object injury, stay in operator zone behind handles and keep children, bystanders, helpers and pets at least 75 feet from mower while it is in operation. Stop machine if anyone enters area.\n9. Always wear safety glasses or safety goggles during operation and while performing an adjustment or repair to protect your eyes. Thrown objects which ricochet can cause serious injury to the eyes.\n10. Wear sturdy, rough-soled work shoes and close-fitting slacks and shirts. Shirts and pants that cover the arms and legs and steel-toed shoes are recommended. Never operate this machine in bare feet, sandals, slippery or lightweight (e.g., canvas) shoes.\n11. Do not put hands or feet near rotating parts or under the cutting deck. Contact with blade can amputate fingers, hands, toes and feet.\n12. A missing or damaged discharge cover can cause blade contact or thrown object injuries.\n13. Many injuries occur as a result of the mower being pulled over the foot during a fall caused by slipping or tripping. Do not hold onto the mower if you are falling; release the handle immediately.\n14. Never pull the mower back toward you while you are walking. If you must back the mower away from a wall or obstruction first look down and behind to avoid tripping and then follow these steps:\n    - Step back from mower to fully extend your arms.\n    - Be sure you are well balanced with sure footing.\n    - Pull the mower back slowly, no more than halfway toward you.\n    - Repeat these steps as needed.\n15. Do not operate the mower while under the influence of alcohol or drugs.\n16. Do not engage the self-propelled mechanism on machines so equipped while starting engine.\n17. The blade control is a safety device. Never attempt to bypass its operation. Doing so makes the safety device inoperative and may result in personal injury through contact with the rotating blade. The blade control must operate easily in both directions and automatically return to the disengaged position when released.\n18. Never operate the mower in wet grass. Always be sure of your footing. A slip and fall can cause serious personal injury. If you feel you are losing your footing, release the blade control handle immediately and the blade will stop rotating within three seconds.\n19. Mow only in daylight or good artificial light. Walk, never run.\n20. Stop the blade when crossing gravel drives, walks or roads.\n21. If the equipment should start to vibrate abnormally, stop the engine and check immediately for the cause. Vibration is generally a warning of trouble.\n22. Shut the engine off and wait until the blade comes to a complete stop before removing the grass catcher or unclogging the chute. The cutting blade continues to rotate for a few seconds after the blade control is released. Never place any part of the body in the blade area until you are sure the blade has stopped rotating.\n23. Never operate mower without proper trail shield, discharge cover, grass catcher, blade control or other safety protective devices in place and working. Never operate mower with damaged safety devices. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.\n24. Muffler and engine become hot and can cause a burn. Do not touch.\n25. Never attempt to make a wheel or cutting height adjustment while the engine is running.\n26. Only use parts and accessories made for this machine by the manufacturer. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.",
            "27. When starting engine, pull cord slowly until resistance is felt, then pull rapidly. Rapid retraction of starter cord (kickback) will pull hand and arm toward engine faster than you can let go. Broken bones, fractures, bruises or sprains could result.\n28. If situations occur which are not covered in this manual, use care and good judgment. Contact Customer Support for assistance and the name of your nearest servicing dealer.",
            "### Children\n\nTragic accidents can occur if the operator is not alert to the presence of children. Children are often attracted to the mower and the mowing activity. They do not understand the dangers. Never assume that children will remain where you last saw them.\n\n1. Keep children out of the mowing area and under watchful care of a responsible adult other than the operator.\n2. Be alert and turn mower off if a child enters the area.\n3. Before and while moving backwards, look behind and down for small children.\n4. Use extreme care when approaching blind corners, doorways, shrubs, trees, or other objects that may block your vision of a child who may run into the mower.\n5. Keep children away from hot or running engines. They can suffer burns from a hot muffler.\n6. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and be trained and supervised by an adult.\n\n### Service\n\nSafe Handling of Gasoline\n\nTo avoid personal injury or property damage, use extreme care in handling gasoline. Gasoline is extremely flammable and the vapors are explosive. Serious personal injury can occur when gasoline is spilled on yourself or your clothes, which can ignite. Wash your skin and change clothes immediately.\n\n1. Use only an approved gasoline container.\n2. Never fill containers inside a vehicle or on a truck or trailer bed with a plastic liner. Always place containers on the ground away from your vehicle before filling.\n3. Remove gas-powered equipment from the truck or trailer and refuel it on the ground. If this is not possible, then refuel such equipment on a trailer with a portable container, rather than from a gasoline dispenser nozzle.\n4. Keep the nozzle in contact with the rim of the fuel tank or container opening at all times until fueling is complete. Do not use a nozzle lock-open device.\n5. Extinguish all cigarettes, cigars, pipes and other sources of ignition.\n6. Never fuel machine indoors because flammable vapors will accumulate in the area.\n7. Never remove gas cap or add fuel while the engine is hot or running. Allow engine to cool at least two minutes before refueling.\n8. Never overfill fuel tank. Fill tank to no more than \u00bd inch below bottom of filler neck to provide space for fuel expansion.\n9. Replace gasoline cap and tighten securely.\n10. If gasoline is spilled, wipe it off the engine and equipment. Move machine to another area. Wait 5 minutes before starting engine.\n11. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light (e.g. furnace, water heater, space heater, clothes dryer, etc.).\n12. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n13. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light such as a water heater, furnace, clothes dryer etc.\n14. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n\n---\n\n## General Service\n\n1. Never run an engine indoors or in a poorly ventilated area. Engine exhaust contains carbon monoxide, an odorless and deadly gas.\n2. Before cleaning, repairing, or inspecting, make certain the blade and all moving parts have stopped. Disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine to prevent unintended starting.\n3. Check the blade and engine mounting bolts at frequent intervals for proper tightness. Also, visually inspect blade for damage (e.g., bent, cracked, worn). Replace blade with the original equipment manufacturer\u2019s (O.E.M.) blade only, listed in this manual. \u201cUse of parts which do not meet the original equipment specifications may lead to improper performance and compromise safety!\u201d\n4. Mower blades are sharp and can cut. Wrap the blade or wear gloves, and use extra caution when servicing them.\n5. Keep all nuts, bolts, and screws tight to be sure the equipment is in safe working condition.\n6. Never tamper with safety devices. Check their proper operation regularly.\n7. After striking a foreign object, stop the engine, disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine. Thoroughly inspect the mower for any damage. Repair the damage before starting and operating the mower.\n8. Never attempt to make adjustments or repairs to the mower while the engine is running.\n9. Grass catcher components are subject to wear, damage and deterioration, which could expose moving parts or allow objects to be thrown. Frequently check components and replace with the manufacturer\u2019s recommended parts when necessary.\n10. Mower blades are sharp and can cut.

            "### DANGER\n\nThis machine was built to be operated according to the safe operation practices in this manual. As with any type of power equipment, carelessness or error on the part of the operator can result in serious injury. This machine is capable of amputating fingers, hands, toes and feet and throwing objects. Failure to observe the following safety instructions could result in serious injury or death.\n\n### General Operation",
            "1. Read this operator's manual carefully in its entirety before attempting to assemble this machine. Read, understand, and follow all instructions on the machine and in the manual(s) before operation. Keep this manual in a safe place for future and regular reference and for ordering replacement parts.\n2. Be completely familiar with the controls and the proper use of this machine before operating it.\n3. This machine is a precision piece of power equipment, not a plaything. Therefore, exercise extreme caution at all times. This machine has been designed to perform one job: to mow grass. Do not use it for any other purpose.\n4. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and should be trained and supervised by an adult.\n5. Only responsible individuals who are familiar with these rules of safe operation should be allowed to use this machine.\n6. Thoroughly inspect the area where the equipment is to be used. Remove all stones, sticks, wire, bones, toys and other foreign objects, which could be tripped over or picked up and thrown by the blade. Thrown objects can cause serious personal injury.\n7. Plan your mowing pattern to avoid discharge of material toward roads, sidewalks, bystanders and the like. Also, avoid discharging material against a wall or obstruction, which may cause discharged material to ricochet back toward the operator.\n8. To help avoid blade contact or a thrown object injury, stay in operator zone behind handles and keep children, bystanders, helpers and pets at least 75 feet from mower while it is in operation. Stop machine if anyone enters area.\n9. Always wear safety glasses or safety goggles during operation and while performing an adjustment or repair to protect your eyes. Thrown objects which ricochet can cause serious injury to the eyes.\n10. Wear sturdy, rough-soled work shoes and close-fitting slacks and shirts. Shirts and pants that cover the arms and legs and steel-toed shoes are recommended. Never operate this machine in bare feet, sandals, slippery or lightweight (e.g., canvas) shoes.\n11. Do not put hands or feet near rotating parts or under the cutting deck. Contact with blade can amputate fingers, hands, toes and feet.\n12. A missing or damaged discharge cover can cause blade contact or thrown object injuries.\n13. Many injuries occur as a result of the mower being pulled over the foot during a fall caused by slipping or tripping. Do not hold onto the mower if you are falling; release the handle immediately.\n14. Never pull the mower back toward you while you are walking. If you must back the mower away from a wall or obstruction first look down and behind to avoid tripping and then follow these steps:\n    - Step back from mower to fully extend your arms.\n    - Be sure you are well balanced with sure footing.\n    - Pull the mower back slowly, no more than halfway toward you.\n    - Repeat these steps as needed.\n15. Do not operate the mower while under the influence of alcohol or drugs.\n16. Do not engage the self-propelled mechanism on machines so equipped while starting engine.\n17. The blade control is a safety device. Never attempt to bypass its operation. Doing so makes the safety device inoperative and may result in personal injury through contact with the rotating blade. The blade control must operate easily in both directions and automatically return to the disengaged position when released.\n18. Never operate the mower in wet grass. Always be sure of your footing. A slip and fall can cause serious personal injury. If you feel you are losing your footing, release the blade control handle immediately and the blade will stop rotating within three seconds.\n19. Mow only in daylight or good artificial light. Walk, never run.\n20. Stop the blade when crossing gravel drives, walks or roads.\n21. If the equipment should start to vibrate abnormally, stop the engine and check immediately for the cause. Vibration is generally a warning of trouble.\n22. Shut the engine off and wait until the blade comes to a complete stop before removing the grass catcher or unclogging the chute. The cutting blade continues to rotate for a few seconds after the blade control is released. Never place any part of the body in the blade area until you are sure the blade has stopped rotating.\n23. Never operate mower without proper trail shield, discharge cover, grass catcher, blade control or other safety protective devices in place and working. Never operate mower with damaged safety devices. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.\n24. Muffler and engine become hot and can cause a burn. Do not touch.\n25. Never attempt to make a wheel or cutting height adjustment while the engine is running.\n26. Only use parts and accessories made for this machine by the manufacturer. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.",
            "27. When starting engine, pull cord slowly until resistance is felt, then pull rapidly. Rapid retraction of starter cord (kickback) will pull hand and arm toward engine faster than you can let go. Broken bones, fractures, bruises or sprains could result.\n28. If situations occur which are not covered in this manual, use care and good judgment. Contact Customer Support for assistance and the name of your nearest servicing dealer.",
            "### Children\n\nTragic accidents can occur if the operator is not alert to the presence of children. Children are often attracted to the mower and the mowing activity. They do not understand the dangers. Never assume that children will remain where you last saw them.\n\n1. Keep children out of the mowing area and under watchful care of a responsible adult other than the operator.\n2. Be alert and turn mower off if a child enters the area.\n3. Before and while moving backwards, look behind and down for small children.\n4. Use extreme care when approaching blind corners, doorways, shrubs, trees, or other objects that may block your vision of a child who may run into the mower.\n5. Keep children away from hot or running engines. They can suffer burns from a hot muffler.\n6. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and be trained and supervised by an adult.\n\n### Service\n\nSafe Handling of Gasoline\n\nTo avoid personal injury or property damage, use extreme care in handling gasoline. Gasoline is extremely flammable and the vapors are explosive. Serious personal injury can occur when gasoline is spilled on yourself or your clothes, which can ignite. Wash your skin and change clothes immediately.\n\n1. Use only an approved gasoline container.\n2. Never fill containers inside a vehicle or on a truck or trailer bed with a plastic liner. Always place containers on the ground away from your vehicle before filling.\n3. Remove gas-powered equipment from the truck or trailer and refuel it on the ground. If this is not possible, then refuel such equipment on a trailer with a portable container, rather than from a gasoline dispenser nozzle.\n4. Keep the nozzle in contact with the rim of the fuel tank or container opening at all times until fueling is complete. Do not use a nozzle lock-open device.\n5. Extinguish all cigarettes, cigars, pipes and other sources of ignition.\n6. Never fuel machine indoors because flammable vapors will accumulate in the area.\n7. Never remove gas cap or add fuel while the engine is hot or running. Allow engine to cool at least two minutes before refueling.\n8. Never overfill fuel tank. Fill tank to no more than \u00bd inch below bottom of filler neck to provide space for fuel expansion.\n9. Replace gasoline cap and tighten securely.\n10. If gasoline is spilled, wipe it off the engine and equipment. Move machine to another area. Wait 5 minutes before starting engine.\n11. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light (e.g. furnace, water heater, space heater, clothes dryer, etc.).\n12. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n13. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light such as a water heater, furnace, clothes dryer etc.\n14. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n\n---\n\n## General Service\n\n1. Never run an engine indoors or in a poorly ventilated area. Engine exhaust contains carbon monoxide, an odorless and deadly gas.\n2. Before cleaning, repairing, or inspecting, make certain the blade and all moving parts have stopped. Disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine to prevent unintended starting.\n3. Check the blade and engine mounting bolts at frequent intervals for proper tightness. Also, visually inspect blade for damage (e.g., bent, cracked, worn). Replace blade with the original equipment manufacturer\u2019s (O.E.M.) blade only, listed in this manual. \u201cUse of parts which do not meet the original equipment specifications may lead to improper performance and compromise safety!\u201d\n4. Mower blades are sharp and can cut. Wrap the blade or wear gloves, and use extra caution when servicing them.\n5. Keep all nuts, bolts, and screws tight to be sure the equipment is in safe working condition.\n6. Never tamper with safety devices. Check their proper operation regularly.\n7. After striking a foreign object, stop the engine, disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine. Thoroughly inspect the mower for any damage. Repair the damage before starting and operating the mower.\n8. Never attempt to make adjustments or repairs to the mower while the engine is running.\n9. Grass catcher components are subject to wear, damage and deterioration, which could expose moving parts or allow objects to be thrown. Frequently check components and replace with the manufacturer\u2019s recommended parts when necessary.\n10. Mower blades are sharp and can cut.

            "### DANGER\n\nThis machine was built to be operated according to the safe operation practices in this manual. As with any type of power equipment, carelessness or error on the part of the operator can result in serious injury. This machine is capable of amputating fingers, hands, toes and feet and throwing objects. Failure to observe the following safety instructions could result in serious injury or death.\n\n### General Operation",
            "1. Read this operator's manual carefully in its entirety before attempting to assemble this machine. Read, understand, and follow all instructions on the machine and in the manual(s) before operation. Keep this manual in a safe place for future and regular reference and for ordering replacement parts.\n2. Be completely familiar with the controls and the proper use of this machine before operating it.\n3. This machine is a precision piece of power equipment, not a plaything. Therefore, exercise extreme caution at all times. This machine has been designed to perform one job: to mow grass. Do not use it for any other purpose.\n4. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and should be trained and supervised by an adult.\n5. Only responsible individuals who are familiar with these rules of safe operation should be allowed to use this machine.\n6. Thoroughly inspect the area where the equipment is to be used. Remove all stones, sticks, wire, bones, toys and other foreign objects, which could be tripped over or picked up and thrown by the blade. Thrown objects can cause serious personal injury.\n7. Plan your mowing pattern to avoid discharge of material toward roads, sidewalks, bystanders and the like. Also, avoid discharging material against a wall or obstruction, which may cause discharged material to ricochet back toward the operator.\n8. To help avoid blade contact or a thrown object injury, stay in operator zone behind handles and keep children, bystanders, helpers and pets at least 75 feet from mower while it is in operation. Stop machine if anyone enters area.\n9. Always wear safety glasses or safety goggles during operation and while performing an adjustment or repair to protect your eyes. Thrown objects which ricochet can cause serious injury to the eyes.\n10. Wear sturdy, rough-soled work shoes and close-fitting slacks and shirts. Shirts and pants that cover the arms and legs and steel-toed shoes are recommended. Never operate this machine in bare feet, sandals, slippery or lightweight (e.g., canvas) shoes.\n11. Do not put hands or feet near rotating parts or under the cutting deck. Contact with blade can amputate fingers, hands, toes and feet.\n12. A missing or damaged discharge cover can cause blade contact or thrown object injuries.\n13. Many injuries occur as a result of the mower being pulled over the foot during a fall caused by slipping or tripping. Do not hold onto the mower if you are falling; release the handle immediately.\n14. Never pull the mower back toward you while you are walking. If you must back the mower away from a wall or obstruction first look down and behind to avoid tripping and then follow these steps:\n    - Step back from mower to fully extend your arms.\n    - Be sure you are well balanced with sure footing.\n    - Pull the mower back slowly, no more than halfway toward you.\n    - Repeat these steps as needed.\n15. Do not operate the mower while under the influence of alcohol or drugs.\n16. Do not engage the self-propelled mechanism on machines so equipped while starting engine.\n17. The blade control is a safety device. Never attempt to bypass its operation. Doing so makes the safety device inoperative and may result in personal injury through contact with the rotating blade. The blade control must operate easily in both directions and automatically return to the disengaged position when released.\n18. Never operate the mower in wet grass. Always be sure of your footing. A slip and fall can cause serious personal injury. If you feel you are losing your footing, release the blade control handle immediately and the blade will stop rotating within three seconds.\n19. Mow only in daylight or good artificial light. Walk, never run.\n20. Stop the blade when crossing gravel drives, walks or roads.\n21. If the equipment should start to vibrate abnormally, stop the engine and check immediately for the cause. Vibration is generally a warning of trouble.\n22. Shut the engine off and wait until the blade comes to a complete stop before removing the grass catcher or unclogging the chute. The cutting blade continues to rotate for a few seconds after the blade control is released. Never place any part of the body in the blade area until you are sure the blade has stopped rotating.\n23. Never operate mower without proper trail shield, discharge cover, grass catcher, blade control or other safety protective devices in place and working. Never operate mower with damaged safety devices. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.\n24. Muffler and engine become hot and can cause a burn. Do not touch.\n25. Never attempt to make a wheel or cutting height adjustment while the engine is running.\n26. Only use parts and accessories made for this machine by the manufacturer. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.",
            "27. When starting engine, pull cord slowly until resistance is felt, then pull rapidly. Rapid retraction of starter cord (kickback) will pull hand and arm toward engine faster than you can let go. Broken bones, fractures, bruises or sprains could result.\n28. If situations occur which are not covered in this manual, use care and good judgment. Contact Customer Support for assistance and the name of your nearest servicing dealer.",
            "### Children\n\nTragic accidents can occur if the operator is not alert to the presence of children. Children are often attracted to the mower and the mowing activity. They do not understand the dangers. Never assume that children will remain where you last saw them.\n\n1. Keep children out of the mowing area and under watchful care of a responsible adult other than the operator.\n2. Be alert and turn mower off if a child enters the area.\n3. Before and while moving backwards, look behind and down for small children.\n4. Use extreme care when approaching blind corners, doorways, shrubs, trees, or other objects that may block your vision of a child who may run into the mower.\n5. Keep children away from hot or running engines. They can suffer burns from a hot muffler.\n6. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and be trained and supervised by an adult.\n\n### Service\n\nSafe Handling of Gasoline\n\nTo avoid personal injury or property damage, use extreme care in handling gasoline. Gasoline is extremely flammable and the vapors are explosive. Serious personal injury can occur when gasoline is spilled on yourself or your clothes, which can ignite. Wash your skin and change clothes immediately.\n\n1. Use only an approved gasoline container.\n2. Never fill containers inside a vehicle or on a truck or trailer bed with a plastic liner. Always place containers on the ground away from your vehicle before filling.\n3. Remove gas-powered equipment from the truck or trailer and refuel it on the ground. If this is not possible, then refuel such equipment on a trailer with a portable container, rather than from a gasoline dispenser nozzle.\n4. Keep the nozzle in contact with the rim of the fuel tank or container opening at all times until fueling is complete. Do not use a nozzle lock-open device.\n5. Extinguish all cigarettes, cigars, pipes and other sources of ignition.\n6. Never fuel machine indoors because flammable vapors will accumulate in the area.\n7. Never remove gas cap or add fuel while the engine is hot or running. Allow engine to cool at least two minutes before refueling.\n8. Never overfill fuel tank. Fill tank to no more than \u00bd inch below bottom of filler neck to provide space for fuel expansion.\n9. Replace gasoline cap and tighten securely.\n10. If gasoline is spilled, wipe it off the engine and equipment. Move machine to another area. Wait 5 minutes before starting engine.\n11. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light (e.g. furnace, water heater, space heater, clothes dryer, etc.).\n12. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n13. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light such as a water heater, furnace, clothes dryer etc.\n14. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n\n---\n\n## General Service\n\n1. Never run an engine indoors or in a poorly ventilated area. Engine exhaust contains carbon monoxide, an odorless and deadly gas.\n2. Before cleaning, repairing, or inspecting, make certain the blade and all moving parts have stopped. Disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine to prevent unintended starting.\n3. Check the blade and engine mounting bolts at frequent intervals for proper tightness. Also, visually inspect blade for damage (e.g., bent, cracked, worn). Replace blade with the original equipment manufacturer\u2019s (O.E.M.) blade only, listed in this manual. \u201cUse of parts which do not meet the original equipment specifications may lead to improper performance and compromise safety!\u201d\n4. Mower blades are sharp and can cut. Wrap the blade or wear gloves, and use extra caution when servicing them.\n5. Keep all nuts, bolts, and screws tight to be sure the equipment is in safe working condition.\n6. Never tamper with safety devices. Check their proper operation regularly.\n7. After striking a foreign object, stop the engine, disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine. Thoroughly inspect the mower for any damage. Repair the damage before starting and operating the mower.\n8. Never attempt to make adjustments or repairs to the mower while the engine is running.\n9. Grass catcher components are subject to wear, damage and deterioration, which could expose moving parts or allow objects to be thrown. Frequently check components and replace with the manufacturer\u2019s recommended parts when necessary.\n10. Mower blades are sharp and can cut.

            "### DANGER\n\nThis machine was built to be operated according to the safe operation practices in this manual. As with any type of power equipment, carelessness or error on the part of the operator can result in serious injury. This machine is capable of amputating fingers, hands, toes and feet and throwing objects. Failure to observe the following safety instructions could result in serious injury or death.\n\n### General Operation",
            "1. Read this operator's manual carefully in its entirety before attempting to assemble this machine. Read, understand, and follow all instructions on the machine and in the manual(s) before operation. Keep this manual in a safe place for future and regular reference and for ordering replacement parts.\n2. Be completely familiar with the controls and the proper use of this machine before operating it.\n3. This machine is a precision piece of power equipment, not a plaything. Therefore, exercise extreme caution at all times. This machine has been designed to perform one job: to mow grass. Do not use it for any other purpose.\n4. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and should be trained and supervised by an adult.\n5. Only responsible individuals who are familiar with these rules of safe operation should be allowed to use this machine.\n6. Thoroughly inspect the area where the equipment is to be used. Remove all stones, sticks, wire, bones, toys and other foreign objects, which could be tripped over or picked up and thrown by the blade. Thrown objects can cause serious personal injury.\n7. Plan your mowing pattern to avoid discharge of material toward roads, sidewalks, bystanders and the like. Also, avoid discharging material against a wall or obstruction, which may cause discharged material to ricochet back toward the operator.\n8. To help avoid blade contact or a thrown object injury, stay in operator zone behind handles and keep children, bystanders, helpers and pets at least 75 feet from mower while it is in operation. Stop machine if anyone enters area.\n9. Always wear safety glasses or safety goggles during operation and while performing an adjustment or repair to protect your eyes. Thrown objects which ricochet can cause serious injury to the eyes.\n10. Wear sturdy, rough-soled work shoes and close-fitting slacks and shirts. Shirts and pants that cover the arms and legs and steel-toed shoes are recommended. Never operate this machine in bare feet, sandals, slippery or lightweight (e.g., canvas) shoes.\n11. Do not put hands or feet near rotating parts or under the cutting deck. Contact with blade can amputate fingers, hands, toes and feet.\n12. A missing or damaged discharge cover can cause blade contact or thrown object injuries.\n13. Many injuries occur as a result of the mower being pulled over the foot during a fall caused by slipping or tripping. Do not hold onto the mower if you are falling; release the handle immediately.\n14. Never pull the mower back toward you while you are walking. If you must back the mower away from a wall or obstruction first look down and behind to avoid tripping and then follow these steps:\n    - Step back from mower to fully extend your arms.\n    - Be sure you are well balanced with sure footing.\n    - Pull the mower back slowly, no more than halfway toward you.\n    - Repeat these steps as needed.\n15. Do not operate the mower while under the influence of alcohol or drugs.\n16. Do not engage the self-propelled mechanism on machines so equipped while starting engine.\n17. The blade control is a safety device. Never attempt to bypass its operation. Doing so makes the safety device inoperative and may result in personal injury through contact with the rotating blade. The blade control must operate easily in both directions and automatically return to the disengaged position when released.\n18. Never operate the mower in wet grass. Always be sure of your footing. A slip and fall can cause serious personal injury. If you feel you are losing your footing, release the blade control handle immediately and the blade will stop rotating within three seconds.\n19. Mow only in daylight or good artificial light. Walk, never run.\n20. Stop the blade when crossing gravel drives, walks or roads.\n21. If the equipment should start to vibrate abnormally, stop the engine and check immediately for the cause. Vibration is generally a warning of trouble.\n22. Shut the engine off and wait until the blade comes to a complete stop before removing the grass catcher or unclogging the chute. The cutting blade continues to rotate for a few seconds after the blade control is released. Never place any part of the body in the blade area until you are sure the blade has stopped rotating.\n23. Never operate mower without proper trail shield, discharge cover, grass catcher, blade control or other safety protective devices in place and working. Never operate mower with damaged safety devices. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.\n24. Muffler and engine become hot and can cause a burn. Do not touch.\n25. Never attempt to make a wheel or cutting height adjustment while the engine is running.\n26. Only use parts and accessories made for this machine by the manufacturer. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.",
            "27. When starting engine, pull cord slowly until resistance is felt, then pull rapidly. Rapid retraction of starter cord (kickback) will pull hand and arm toward engine faster than you can let go. Broken bones, fractures, bruises or sprains could result.\n28. If situations occur which are not covered in this manual, use care and good judgment. Contact Customer Support for assistance and the name of your nearest servicing dealer.",
            "### Children\n\nTragic accidents can occur if the operator is not alert to the presence of children. Children are often attracted to the mower and the mowing activity. They do not understand the dangers. Never assume that children will remain where you last saw them.\n\n1. Keep children out of the mowing area and under watchful care of a responsible adult other than the operator.\n2. Be alert and turn mower off if a child enters the area.\n3. Before and while moving backwards, look behind and down for small children.\n4. Use extreme care when approaching blind corners, doorways, shrubs, trees, or other objects that may block your vision of a child who may run into the mower.\n5. Keep children away from hot or running engines. They can suffer burns from a hot muffler.\n6. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and be trained and supervised by an adult.\n\n### Service\n\nSafe Handling of Gasoline\n\nTo avoid personal injury or property damage, use extreme care in handling gasoline. Gasoline is extremely flammable and the vapors are explosive. Serious personal injury can occur when gasoline is spilled on yourself or your clothes, which can ignite. Wash your skin and change clothes immediately.\n\n1. Use only an approved gasoline container.\n2. Never fill containers inside a vehicle or on a truck or trailer bed with a plastic liner. Always place containers on the ground away from your vehicle before filling.\n3. Remove gas-powered equipment from the truck or trailer and refuel it on the ground. If this is not possible, then refuel such equipment on a trailer with a portable container, rather than from a gasoline dispenser nozzle.\n4. Keep the nozzle in contact with the rim of the fuel tank or container opening at all times until fueling is complete. Do not use a nozzle lock-open device.\n5. Extinguish all cigarettes, cigars, pipes and other sources of ignition.\n6. Never fuel machine indoors because flammable vapors will accumulate in the area.\n7. Never remove gas cap or add fuel while the engine is hot or running. Allow engine to cool at least two minutes before refueling.\n8. Never overfill fuel tank. Fill tank to no more than \u00bd inch below bottom of filler neck to provide space for fuel expansion.\n9. Replace gasoline cap and tighten securely.\n10. If gasoline is spilled, wipe it off the engine and equipment. Move machine to another area. Wait 5 minutes before starting engine.\n11. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light (e.g. furnace, water heater, space heater, clothes dryer, etc.).\n12. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n13. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light such as a water heater, furnace, clothes dryer etc.\n14. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n\n---\n\n## General Service\n\n1. Never run an engine indoors or in a poorly ventilated area. Engine exhaust contains carbon monoxide, an odorless and deadly gas.\n2. Before cleaning, repairing, or inspecting, make certain the blade and all moving parts have stopped. Disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine to prevent unintended starting.\n3. Check the blade and engine mounting bolts at frequent intervals for proper tightness. Also, visually inspect blade for damage (e.g., bent, cracked, worn). Replace blade with the original equipment manufacturer\u2019s (O.E.M.) blade only, listed in this manual. \u201cUse of parts which do not meet the original equipment specifications may lead to improper performance and compromise safety!\u201d\n4. Mower blades are sharp and can cut. Wrap the blade or wear gloves, and use extra caution when servicing them.\n5. Keep all nuts, bolts, and screws tight to be sure the equipment is in safe working condition.\n6. Never tamper with safety devices. Check their proper operation regularly.\n7. After striking a foreign object, stop the engine, disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine. Thoroughly inspect the mower for any damage. Repair the damage before starting and operating the mower.\n8. Never attempt to make adjustments or repairs to the mower while the engine is running.\n9. Grass catcher components are subject to wear, damage and deterioration, which could expose moving parts or allow objects to be thrown. Frequently check components and replace with the manufacturer\u2019s recommended parts when necessary.\n10. Mower blades are sharp and can cut.

            "### DANGER\n\nThis machine was built to be operated according to the safe operation practices in this manual. As with any type of power equipment, carelessness or error on the part of the operator can result in serious injury. This machine is capable of amputating fingers, hands, toes and feet and throwing objects. Failure to observe the following safety instructions could result in serious injury or death.\n\n### General Operation",
            "1. Read this operator's manual carefully in its entirety before attempting to assemble this machine. Read, understand, and follow all instructions on the machine and in the manual(s) before operation. Keep this manual in a safe place for future and regular reference and for ordering replacement parts.\n2. Be completely familiar with the controls and the proper use of this machine before operating it.\n3. This machine is a precision piece of power equipment, not a plaything. Therefore, exercise extreme caution at all times. This machine has been designed to perform one job: to mow grass. Do not use it for any other purpose.\n4. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and should be trained and supervised by an adult.\n5. Only responsible individuals who are familiar with these rules of safe operation should be allowed to use this machine.\n6. Thoroughly inspect the area where the equipment is to be used. Remove all stones, sticks, wire, bones, toys and other foreign objects, which could be tripped over or picked up and thrown by the blade. Thrown objects can cause serious personal injury.\n7. Plan your mowing pattern to avoid discharge of material toward roads, sidewalks, bystanders and the like. Also, avoid discharging material against a wall or obstruction, which may cause discharged material to ricochet back toward the operator.\n8. To help avoid blade contact or a thrown object injury, stay in operator zone behind handles and keep children, bystanders, helpers and pets at least 75 feet from mower while it is in operation. Stop machine if anyone enters area.\n9. Always wear safety glasses or safety goggles during operation and while performing an adjustment or repair to protect your eyes. Thrown objects which ricochet can cause serious injury to the eyes.\n10. Wear sturdy, rough-soled work shoes and close-fitting slacks and shirts. Shirts and pants that cover the arms and legs and steel-toed shoes are recommended. Never operate this machine in bare feet, sandals, slippery or lightweight (e.g., canvas) shoes.\n11. Do not put hands or feet near rotating parts or under the cutting deck. Contact with blade can amputate fingers, hands, toes and feet.\n12. A missing or damaged discharge cover can cause blade contact or thrown object injuries.\n13. Many injuries occur as a result of the mower being pulled over the foot during a fall caused by slipping or tripping. Do not hold onto the mower if you are falling; release the handle immediately.\n14. Never pull the mower back toward you while you are walking. If you must back the mower away from a wall or obstruction first look down and behind to avoid tripping and then follow these steps:\n    - Step back from mower to fully extend your arms.\n    - Be sure you are well balanced with sure footing.\n    - Pull the mower back slowly, no more than halfway toward you.\n    - Repeat these steps as needed.\n15. Do not operate the mower while under the influence of alcohol or drugs.\n16. Do not engage the self-propelled mechanism on machines so equipped while starting engine.\n17. The blade control is a safety device. Never attempt to bypass its operation. Doing so makes the safety device inoperative and may result in personal injury through contact with the rotating blade. The blade control must operate easily in both directions and automatically return to the disengaged position when released.\n18. Never operate the mower in wet grass. Always be sure of your footing. A slip and fall can cause serious personal injury. If you feel you are losing your footing, release the blade control handle immediately and the blade will stop rotating within three seconds.\n19. Mow only in daylight or good artificial light. Walk, never run.\n20. Stop the blade when crossing gravel drives, walks or roads.\n21. If the equipment should start to vibrate abnormally, stop the engine and check immediately for the cause. Vibration is generally a warning of trouble.\n22. Shut the engine off and wait until the blade comes to a complete stop before removing the grass catcher or unclogging the chute. The cutting blade continues to rotate for a few seconds after the blade control is released. Never place any part of the body in the blade area until you are sure the blade has stopped rotating.\n23. Never operate mower without proper trail shield, discharge cover, grass catcher, blade control or other safety protective devices in place and working. Never operate mower with damaged safety devices. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.\n24. Muffler and engine become hot and can cause a burn. Do not touch.\n25. Never attempt to make a wheel or cutting height adjustment while the engine is running.\n26. Only use parts and accessories made for this machine by the manufacturer. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.",
            "27. When starting engine, pull cord slowly until resistance is felt, then pull rapidly. Rapid retraction of starter cord (kickback) will pull hand and arm toward engine faster than you can let go. Broken bones, fractures, bruises or sprains could result.\n28. If situations occur which are not covered in this manual, use care and good judgment. Contact Customer Support for assistance and the name of your nearest servicing dealer.",
            "### Children\n\nTragic accidents can occur if the operator is not alert to the presence of children. Children are often attracted to the mower and the mowing activity. They do not understand the dangers. Never assume that children will remain where you last saw them.\n\n1. Keep children out of the mowing area and under watchful care of a responsible adult other than the operator.\n2. Be alert and turn mower off if a child enters the area.\n3. Before and while moving backwards, look behind and down for small children.\n4. Use extreme care when approaching blind corners, doorways, shrubs, trees, or other objects that may block your vision of a child who may run into the mower.\n5. Keep children away from hot or running engines. They can suffer burns from a hot muffler.\n6. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and be trained and supervised by an adult.\n\n### Service\n\nSafe Handling of Gasoline\n\nTo avoid personal injury or property damage, use extreme care in handling gasoline. Gasoline is extremely flammable and the vapors are explosive. Serious personal injury can occur when gasoline is spilled on yourself or your clothes, which can ignite. Wash your skin and change clothes immediately.\n\n1. Use only an approved gasoline container.\n2. Never fill containers inside a vehicle or on a truck or trailer bed with a plastic liner. Always place containers on the ground away from your vehicle before filling.\n3. Remove gas-powered equipment from the truck or trailer and refuel it on the ground. If this is not possible, then refuel such equipment on a trailer with a portable container, rather than from a gasoline dispenser nozzle.\n4. Keep the nozzle in contact with the rim of the fuel tank or container opening at all times until fueling is complete. Do not use a nozzle lock-open device.\n5. Extinguish all cigarettes, cigars, pipes and other sources of ignition.\n6. Never fuel machine indoors because flammable vapors will accumulate in the area.\n7. Never remove gas cap or add fuel while the engine is hot or running. Allow engine to cool at least two minutes before refueling.\n8. Never overfill fuel tank. Fill tank to no more than \u00bd inch below bottom of filler neck to provide space for fuel expansion.\n9. Replace gasoline cap and tighten securely.\n10. If gasoline is spilled, wipe it off the engine and equipment. Move machine to another area. Wait 5 minutes before starting engine.\n11. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light (e.g. furnace, water heater, space heater, clothes dryer, etc.).\n12. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n13. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light such as a water heater, furnace, clothes dryer etc.\n14. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n\n---\n\n## General Service\n\n1. Never run an engine indoors or in a poorly ventilated area. Engine exhaust contains carbon monoxide, an odorless and deadly gas.\n2. Before cleaning, repairing, or inspecting, make certain the blade and all moving parts have stopped. Disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine to prevent unintended starting.\n3. Check the blade and engine mounting bolts at frequent intervals for proper tightness. Also, visually inspect blade for damage (e.g., bent, cracked, worn). Replace blade with the original equipment manufacturer\u2019s (O.E.M.) blade only, listed in this manual. \u201cUse of parts which do not meet the original equipment specifications may lead to improper performance and compromise safety!\u201d\n4. Mower blades are sharp and can cut. Wrap the blade or wear gloves, and use extra caution when servicing them.\n5. Keep all nuts, bolts, and screws tight to be sure the equipment is in safe working condition.\n6. Never tamper with safety devices. Check their proper operation regularly.\n7. After striking a foreign object, stop the engine, disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine. Thoroughly inspect the mower for any damage. Repair the damage before starting and operating the mower.\n8. Never attempt to make adjustments or repairs to the mower while the engine is running.\n9. Grass catcher components are subject to wear, damage and deterioration, which could expose moving parts or allow objects to be thrown. Frequently check components and replace with the manufacturer\u2019s recommended parts when necessary.\n10. Mower blades are sharp and can cut.

            "### DANGER\n\nThis machine was built to be operated according to the safe operation practices in this manual. As with any type of power equipment, carelessness or error on the part of the operator can result in serious injury. This machine is capable of amputating fingers, hands, toes and feet and throwing objects. Failure to observe the following safety instructions could result in serious injury or death.\n\n### General Operation",
            "1. Read this operator's manual carefully in its entirety before attempting to assemble this machine. Read, understand, and follow all instructions on the machine and in the manual(s) before operation. Keep this manual in a safe place for future and regular reference and for ordering replacement parts.\n2. Be completely familiar with the controls and the proper use of this machine before operating it.\n3. This machine is a precision piece of power equipment, not a plaything. Therefore, exercise extreme caution at all times. This machine has been designed to perform one job: to mow grass. Do not use it for any other purpose.\n4. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and should be trained and supervised by an adult.\n5. Only responsible individuals who are familiar with these rules of safe operation should be allowed to use this machine.\n6. Thoroughly inspect the area where the equipment is to be used. Remove all stones, sticks, wire, bones, toys and other foreign objects, which could be tripped over or picked up and thrown by the blade. Thrown objects can cause serious personal injury.\n7. Plan your mowing pattern to avoid discharge of material toward roads, sidewalks, bystanders and the like. Also, avoid discharging material against a wall or obstruction, which may cause discharged material to ricochet back toward the operator.\n8. To help avoid blade contact or a thrown object injury, stay in operator zone behind handles and keep children, bystanders, helpers and pets at least 75 feet from mower while it is in operation. Stop machine if anyone enters area.\n9. Always wear safety glasses or safety goggles during operation and while performing an adjustment or repair to protect your eyes. Thrown objects which ricochet can cause serious injury to the eyes.\n10. Wear sturdy, rough-soled work shoes and close-fitting slacks and shirts. Shirts and pants that cover the arms and legs and steel-toed shoes are recommended. Never operate this machine in bare feet, sandals, slippery or lightweight (e.g., canvas) shoes.\n11. Do not put hands or feet near rotating parts or under the cutting deck. Contact with blade can amputate fingers, hands, toes and feet.\n12. A missing or damaged discharge cover can cause blade contact or thrown object injuries.\n13. Many injuries occur as a result of the mower being pulled over the foot during a fall caused by slipping or tripping. Do not hold onto the mower if you are falling; release the handle immediately.\n14. Never pull the mower back toward you while you are walking. If you must back the mower away from a wall or obstruction first look down and behind to avoid tripping and then follow these steps:\n    - Step back from mower to fully extend your arms.\n    - Be sure you are well balanced with sure footing.\n    - Pull the mower back slowly, no more than halfway toward you.\n    - Repeat these steps as needed.\n15. Do not operate the mower while under the influence of alcohol or drugs.\n16. Do not engage the self-propelled mechanism on machines so equipped while starting engine.\n17. The blade control is a safety device. Never attempt to bypass its operation. Doing so makes the safety device inoperative and may result in personal injury through contact with the rotating blade. The blade control must operate easily in both directions and automatically return to the disengaged position when released.\n18. Never operate the mower in wet grass. Always be sure of your footing. A slip and fall can cause serious personal injury. If you feel you are losing your footing, release the blade control handle immediately and the blade will stop rotating within three seconds.\n19. Mow only in daylight or good artificial light. Walk, never run.\n20. Stop the blade when crossing gravel drives, walks or roads.\n21. If the equipment should start to vibrate abnormally, stop the engine and check immediately for the cause. Vibration is generally a warning of trouble.\n22. Shut the engine off and wait until the blade comes to a complete stop before removing the grass catcher or unclogging the chute. The cutting blade continues to rotate for a few seconds after the blade control is released. Never place any part of the body in the blade area until you are sure the blade has stopped rotating.\n23. Never operate mower without proper trail shield, discharge cover, grass catcher, blade control or other safety protective devices in place and working. Never operate mower with damaged safety devices. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.\n24. Muffler and engine become hot and can cause a burn. Do not touch.\n25. Never attempt to make a wheel or cutting height adjustment while the engine is running.\n26. Only use parts and accessories made for this machine by the manufacturer. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.",
            "27. When starting engine, pull cord slowly until resistance is felt, then pull rapidly. Rapid retraction of starter cord (kickback) will pull hand and arm toward engine faster than you can let go. Broken bones, fractures, bruises or sprains could result.\n28. If situations occur which are not covered in this manual, use care and good judgment. Contact Customer Support for assistance and the name of your nearest servicing dealer.",
            "### Children\n\nTragic accidents can occur if the operator is not alert to the presence of children. Children are often attracted to the mower and the mowing activity. They do not understand the dangers. Never assume that children will remain where you last saw them.\n\n1. Keep children out of the mowing area and under watchful care of a responsible adult other than the operator.\n2. Be alert and turn mower off if a child enters the area.\n3. Before and while moving backwards, look behind and down for small children.\n4. Use extreme care when approaching blind corners, doorways, shrubs, trees, or other objects that may block your vision of a child who may run into the mower.\n5. Keep children away from hot or running engines. They can suffer burns from a hot muffler.\n6. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and be trained and supervised by an adult.\n\n### Service\n\nSafe Handling of Gasoline\n\nTo avoid personal injury or property damage, use extreme care in handling gasoline. Gasoline is extremely flammable and the vapors are explosive. Serious personal injury can occur when gasoline is spilled on yourself or your clothes, which can ignite. Wash your skin and change clothes immediately.\n\n1. Use only an approved gasoline container.\n2. Never fill containers inside a vehicle or on a truck or trailer bed with a plastic liner. Always place containers on the ground away from your vehicle before filling.\n3. Remove gas-powered equipment from the truck or trailer and refuel it on the ground. If this is not possible, then refuel such equipment on a trailer with a portable container, rather than from a gasoline dispenser nozzle.\n4. Keep the nozzle in contact with the rim of the fuel tank or container opening at all times until fueling is complete. Do not use a nozzle lock-open device.\n5. Extinguish all cigarettes, cigars, pipes and other sources of ignition.\n6. Never fuel machine indoors because flammable vapors will accumulate in the area.\n7. Never remove gas cap or add fuel while the engine is hot or running. Allow engine to cool at least two minutes before refueling.\n8. Never overfill fuel tank. Fill tank to no more than \u00bd inch below bottom of filler neck to provide space for fuel expansion.\n9. Replace gasoline cap and tighten securely.\n10. If gasoline is spilled, wipe it off the engine and equipment. Move machine to another area. Wait 5 minutes before starting engine.\n11. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light (e.g. furnace, water heater, space heater, clothes dryer, etc.).\n12. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n13. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light such as a water heater, furnace, clothes dryer etc.\n14. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n\n---\n\n## General Service\n\n1. Never run an engine indoors or in a poorly ventilated area. Engine exhaust contains carbon monoxide, an odorless and deadly gas.\n2. Before cleaning, repairing, or inspecting, make certain the blade and all moving parts have stopped. Disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine to prevent unintended starting.\n3. Check the blade and engine mounting bolts at frequent intervals for proper tightness. Also, visually inspect blade for damage (e.g., bent, cracked, worn). Replace blade with the original equipment manufacturer\u2019s (O.E.M.) blade only, listed in this manual. \u201cUse of parts which do not meet the original equipment specifications may lead to improper performance and compromise safety!\u201d\n4. Mower blades are sharp and can cut. Wrap the blade or wear gloves, and use extra caution when servicing them.\n5. Keep all nuts, bolts, and screws tight to be sure the equipment is in safe working condition.\n6. Never tamper with safety devices. Check their proper operation regularly.\n7. After striking a foreign object, stop the engine, disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine. Thoroughly inspect the mower for any damage. Repair the damage before starting and operating the mower.\n8. Never attempt to make adjustments or repairs to the mower while the engine is running.\n9. Grass catcher components are subject to wear, damage and deterioration, which could expose moving parts or allow objects to be thrown. Frequently check components and replace with the manufacturer\u2019s recommended parts when necessary.\n10. Mower blades are sharp and can cut. Wrap the blade or wear gloves, and use extra caution when servicing them.\n11. Do not change the engine governor setting or over-speed the engine.

            "### DANGER\n\nThis machine was built to be operated according to the safe operation practices in this manual. As with any type of power equipment, carelessness or error on the part of the operator can result in serious injury. This machine is capable of amputating fingers, hands, toes and feet and throwing objects. Failure to observe the following safety instructions could result in serious injury or death.\n\n### General Operation",
            "1. Read this operator's manual carefully in its entirety before attempting to assemble this machine. Read, understand, and follow all instructions on the machine and in the manual(s) before operation. Keep this manual in a safe place for future and regular reference and for ordering replacement parts.\n2. Be completely familiar with the controls and the proper use of this machine before operating it.\n3. This machine is a precision piece of power equipment, not a plaything. Therefore, exercise extreme caution at all times. This machine has been designed to perform one job: to mow grass. Do not use it for any other purpose.\n4. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and should be trained and supervised by an adult.\n5. Only responsible individuals who are familiar with these rules of safe operation should be allowed to use this machine.\n6. Thoroughly inspect the area where the equipment is to be used. Remove all stones, sticks, wire, bones, toys and other foreign objects, which could be tripped over or picked up and thrown by the blade. Thrown objects can cause serious personal injury.\n7. Plan your mowing pattern to avoid discharge of material toward roads, sidewalks, bystanders and the like. Also, avoid discharging material against a wall or obstruction, which may cause discharged material to ricochet back toward the operator.\n8. To help avoid blade contact or a thrown object injury, stay in operator zone behind handles and keep children, bystanders, helpers and pets at least 75 feet from mower while it is in operation. Stop machine if anyone enters area.\n9. Always wear safety glasses or safety goggles during operation and while performing an adjustment or repair to protect your eyes. Thrown objects which ricochet can cause serious injury to the eyes.\n10. Wear sturdy, rough-soled work shoes and close-fitting slacks and shirts. Shirts and pants that cover the arms and legs and steel-toed shoes are recommended. Never operate this machine in bare feet, sandals, slippery or lightweight (e.g., canvas) shoes.\n11. Do not put hands or feet near rotating parts or under the cutting deck. Contact with blade can amputate fingers, hands, toes and feet.\n12. A missing or damaged discharge cover can cause blade contact or thrown object injuries.\n13. Many injuries occur as a result of the mower being pulled over the foot during a fall caused by slipping or tripping. Do not hold onto the mower if you are falling; release the handle immediately.\n14. Never pull the mower back toward you while you are walking. If you must back the mower away from a wall or obstruction first look down and behind to avoid tripping and then follow these steps:\n    - Step back from mower to fully extend your arms.\n    - Be sure you are well balanced with sure footing.\n    - Pull the mower back slowly, no more than halfway toward you.\n    - Repeat these steps as needed.\n15. Do not operate the mower while under the influence of alcohol or drugs.\n16. Do not engage the self-propelled mechanism on machines so equipped while starting engine.\n17. The blade control is a safety device. Never attempt to bypass its operation. Doing so makes the safety device inoperative and may result in personal injury through contact with the rotating blade. The blade control must operate easily in both directions and automatically return to the disengaged position when released.\n18. Never operate the mower in wet grass. Always be sure of your footing. A slip and fall can cause serious personal injury. If you feel you are losing your footing, release the blade control handle immediately and the blade will stop rotating within three seconds.\n19. Mow only in daylight or good artificial light. Walk, never run.\n20. Stop the blade when crossing gravel drives, walks or roads.\n21. If the equipment should start to vibrate abnormally, stop the engine and check immediately for the cause. Vibration is generally a warning of trouble.\n22. Shut the engine off and wait until the blade comes to a complete stop before removing the grass catcher or unclogging the chute. The cutting blade continues to rotate for a few seconds after the blade control is released. Never place any part of the body in the blade area until you are sure the blade has stopped rotating.\n23. Never operate mower without proper trail shield, discharge cover, grass catcher, blade control or other safety protective devices in place and working. Never operate mower with damaged safety devices. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.\n24. Muffler and engine become hot and can cause a burn. Do not touch.\n25. Never attempt to make a wheel or cutting height adjustment while the engine is running.\n26. Only use parts and accessories made for this machine by the manufacturer. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.",
            "27. When starting engine, pull cord slowly until resistance is felt, then pull rapidly. Rapid retraction of starter cord (kickback) will pull hand and arm toward engine faster than you can let go. Broken bones, fractures, bruises or sprains could result.\n28. If situations occur which are not covered in this manual, use care and good judgment. Contact Customer Support for assistance and the name of your nearest servicing dealer.",
            "### Children\n\nTragic accidents can occur if the operator is not alert to the presence of children. Children are often attracted to the mower and the mowing activity. They do not understand the dangers. Never assume that children will remain where you last saw them.\n\n1. Keep children out of the mowing area and under watchful care of a responsible adult other than the operator.\n2. Be alert and turn mower off if a child enters the area.\n3. Before and while moving backwards, look behind and down for small children.\n4. Use extreme care when approaching blind corners, doorways, shrubs, trees, or other objects that may block your vision of a child who may run into the mower.\n5. Keep children away from hot or running engines. They can suffer burns from a hot muffler.\n6. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and be trained and supervised by an adult.\n\n### Service\n\nSafe Handling of Gasoline\n\nTo avoid personal injury or property damage, use extreme care in handling gasoline. Gasoline is extremely flammable and the vapors are explosive. Serious personal injury can occur when gasoline is spilled on yourself or your clothes, which can ignite. Wash your skin and change clothes immediately.\n\n1. Use only an approved gasoline container.\n2. Never fill containers inside a vehicle or on a truck or trailer bed with a plastic liner. Always place containers on the ground away from your vehicle before filling.\n3. Remove gas-powered equipment from the truck or trailer and refuel it on the ground. If this is not possible, then refuel such equipment on a trailer with a portable container, rather than from a gasoline dispenser nozzle.\n4. Keep the nozzle in contact with the rim of the fuel tank or container opening at all times until fueling is complete. Do not use a nozzle lock-open device.\n5. Extinguish all cigarettes, cigars, pipes and other sources of ignition.\n6. Never fuel machine indoors because flammable vapors will accumulate in the area.\n7. Never remove gas cap or add fuel while the engine is hot or running. Allow engine to cool at least two minutes before refueling.\n8. Never overfill fuel tank. Fill tank to no more than \u00bd inch below bottom of filler neck to provide space for fuel expansion.\n9. Replace gasoline cap and tighten securely.\n10. If gasoline is spilled, wipe it off the engine and equipment. Move machine to another area. Wait 5 minutes before starting engine.\n11. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light (e.g. furnace, water heater, space heater, clothes dryer, etc.).\n12. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n13. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light such as a water heater, furnace, clothes dryer etc.\n14. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n\n---\n\n## General Service\n\n1. Never run an engine indoors or in a poorly ventilated area. Engine exhaust contains carbon monoxide, an odorless and deadly gas.\n2. Before cleaning, repairing, or inspecting, make certain the blade and all moving parts have stopped. Disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine to prevent unintended starting.\n3. Check the blade and engine mounting bolts at frequent intervals for proper tightness. Also, visually inspect blade for damage (e.g., bent, cracked, worn). Replace blade with the original equipment manufacturer\u2019s (O.E.M.) blade only, listed in this manual. \u201cUse of parts which do not meet the original equipment specifications may lead to improper performance and compromise safety!\u201d\n4. Mower blades are sharp and can cut. Wrap the blade or wear gloves, and use extra caution when servicing them.\n5. Keep all nuts, bolts, and screws tight to be sure the equipment is in safe working condition.\n6. Never tamper with safety devices. Check their proper operation regularly.\n7. After striking a foreign object, stop the engine, disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine. Thoroughly inspect the mower for any damage. Repair the damage before starting and operating the mower.\n8. Never attempt to make adjustments or repairs to the mower while the engine is running.\n9. Grass catcher components are subject to wear, damage and deterioration, which could expose moving parts or allow objects to be thrown. Frequently check components and replace with the manufacturer\u2019s recommended parts when necessary.\n10. Mower blades are sharp and can cut.

            "### DANGER\n\nThis machine was built to be operated according to the safe operation practices in this manual. As with any type of power equipment, carelessness or error on the part of the operator can result in serious injury. This machine is capable of amputating fingers, hands, toes and feet and throwing objects. Failure to observe the following safety instructions could result in serious injury or death.\n\n### General Operation",
            "1. Read this operator's manual carefully in its entirety before attempting to assemble this machine. Read, understand, and follow all instructions on the machine and in the manual(s) before operation. Keep this manual in a safe place for future and regular reference and for ordering replacement parts.\n2. Be completely familiar with the controls and the proper use of this machine before operating it.\n3. This machine is a precision piece of power equipment, not a plaything. Therefore, exercise extreme caution at all times. This machine has been designed to perform one job: to mow grass. Do not use it for any other purpose.\n4. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and should be trained and supervised by an adult.\n5. Only responsible individuals who are familiar with these rules of safe operation should be allowed to use this machine.\n6. Thoroughly inspect the area where the equipment is to be used. Remove all stones, sticks, wire, bones, toys and other foreign objects, which could be tripped over or picked up and thrown by the blade. Thrown objects can cause serious personal injury.\n7. Plan your mowing pattern to avoid discharge of material toward roads, sidewalks, bystanders and the like. Also, avoid discharging material against a wall or obstruction, which may cause discharged material to ricochet back toward the operator.\n8. To help avoid blade contact or a thrown object injury, stay in operator zone behind handles and keep children, bystanders, helpers and pets at least 75 feet from mower while it is in operation. Stop machine if anyone enters area.\n9. Always wear safety glasses or safety goggles during operation and while performing an adjustment or repair to protect your eyes. Thrown objects which ricochet can cause serious injury to the eyes.\n10. Wear sturdy, rough-soled work shoes and close-fitting slacks and shirts. Shirts and pants that cover the arms and legs and steel-toed shoes are recommended. Never operate this machine in bare feet, sandals, slippery or lightweight (e.g., canvas) shoes.\n11. Do not put hands or feet near rotating parts or under the cutting deck. Contact with blade can amputate fingers, hands, toes and feet.\n12. A missing or damaged discharge cover can cause blade contact or thrown object injuries.\n13. Many injuries occur as a result of the mower being pulled over the foot during a fall caused by slipping or tripping. Do not hold onto the mower if you are falling; release the handle immediately.\n14. Never pull the mower back toward you while you are walking. If you must back the mower away from a wall or obstruction first look down and behind to avoid tripping and then follow these steps:\n    - Step back from mower to fully extend your arms.\n    - Be sure you are well balanced with sure footing.\n    - Pull the mower back slowly, no more than halfway toward you.\n    - Repeat these steps as needed.\n15. Do not operate the mower while under the influence of alcohol or drugs.\n16. Do not engage the self-propelled mechanism on machines so equipped while starting engine.\n17. The blade control is a safety device. Never attempt to bypass its operation. Doing so makes the safety device inoperative and may result in personal injury through contact with the rotating blade. The blade control must operate easily in both directions and automatically return to the disengaged position when released.\n18. Never operate the mower in wet grass. Always be sure of your footing. A slip and fall can cause serious personal injury. If you feel you are losing your footing, release the blade control handle immediately and the blade will stop rotating within three seconds.\n19. Mow only in daylight or good artificial light. Walk, never run.\n20. Stop the blade when crossing gravel drives, walks or roads.\n21. If the equipment should start to vibrate abnormally, stop the engine and check immediately for the cause. Vibration is generally a warning of trouble.\n22. Shut the engine off and wait until the blade comes to a complete stop before removing the grass catcher or unclogging the chute. The cutting blade continues to rotate for a few seconds after the blade control is released. Never place any part of the body in the blade area until you are sure the blade has stopped rotating.\n23. Never operate mower without proper trail shield, discharge cover, grass catcher, blade control or other safety protective devices in place and working. Never operate mower with damaged safety devices. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.\n24. Muffler and engine become hot and can cause a burn. Do not touch.\n25. Never attempt to make a wheel or cutting height adjustment while the engine is running.\n26. Only use parts and accessories made for this machine by the manufacturer. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.",
            "27. When starting engine, pull cord slowly until resistance is felt, then pull rapidly. Rapid retraction of starter cord (kickback) will pull hand and arm toward engine faster than you can let go. Broken bones, fractures, bruises or sprains could result.\n28. If situations occur which are not covered in this manual, use care and good judgment. Contact Customer Support for assistance and the name of your nearest servicing dealer.",
            "### Children\n\nTragic accidents can occur if the operator is not alert to the presence of children. Children are often attracted to the mower and the mowing activity. They do not understand the dangers. Never assume that children will remain where you last saw them.\n\n1. Keep children out of the mowing area and under watchful care of a responsible adult other than the operator.\n2. Be alert and turn mower off if a child enters the area.\n3. Before and while moving backwards, look behind and down for small children.\n4. Use extreme care when approaching blind corners, doorways, shrubs, trees, or other objects that may block your vision of a child who may run into the mower.\n5. Keep children away from hot or running engines. They can suffer burns from a hot muffler.\n6. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and be trained and supervised by an adult.\n\n### Service\n\nSafe Handling of Gasoline\n\nTo avoid personal injury or property damage, use extreme care in handling gasoline. Gasoline is extremely flammable and the vapors are explosive. Serious personal injury can occur when gasoline is spilled on yourself or your clothes, which can ignite. Wash your skin and change clothes immediately.\n\n1. Use only an approved gasoline container.\n2. Never fill containers inside a vehicle or on a truck or trailer bed with a plastic liner. Always place containers on the ground away from your vehicle before filling.\n3. Remove gas-powered equipment from the truck or trailer and refuel it on the ground. If this is not possible, then refuel such equipment on a trailer with a portable container, rather than from a gasoline dispenser nozzle.\n4. Keep the nozzle in contact with the rim of the fuel tank or container opening at all times until fueling is complete. Do not use a nozzle lock-open device.\n5. Extinguish all cigarettes, cigars, pipes and other sources of ignition.\n6. Never fuel machine indoors because flammable vapors will accumulate in the area.\n7. Never remove gas cap or add fuel while the engine is hot or running. Allow engine to cool at least two minutes before refueling.\n8. Never overfill fuel tank. Fill tank to no more than \u00bd inch below bottom of filler neck to provide space for fuel expansion.\n9. Replace gasoline cap and tighten securely.\n10. If gasoline is spilled, wipe it off the engine and equipment. Move machine to another area. Wait 5 minutes before starting engine.\n11. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light (e.g. furnace, water heater, space heater, clothes dryer, etc.).\n12. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n13. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light such as a water heater, furnace, clothes dryer etc.\n14. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n\n---\n\n## General Service\n\n1. Never run an engine indoors or in a poorly ventilated area. Engine exhaust contains carbon monoxide, an odorless and deadly gas.\n2. Before cleaning, repairing, or inspecting, make certain the blade and all moving parts have stopped. Disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine to prevent unintended starting.\n3. Check the blade and engine mounting bolts at frequent intervals for proper tightness. Also, visually inspect blade for damage (e.g., bent, cracked, worn). Replace blade with the original equipment manufacturer\u2019s (O.E.M.) blade only, listed in this manual. \u201cUse of parts which do not meet the original equipment specifications may lead to improper performance and compromise safety!\u201d\n4. Mower blades are sharp and can cut. Wrap the blade or wear gloves, and use extra caution when servicing them.\n5. Keep all nuts, bolts, and screws tight to be sure the equipment is in safe working condition.\n6. Never tamper with safety devices. Check their proper operation regularly.\n7. After striking a foreign object, stop the engine, disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine. Thoroughly inspect the mower for any damage. Repair the damage before starting and operating the mower.\n8. Never attempt to make adjustments or repairs to the mower while the engine is running.\n9. Grass catcher components are subject to wear, damage and deterioration, which could expose moving parts or allow objects to be thrown. Frequently check components and replace with the manufacturer\u2019s recommended parts when necessary.\n10. Mower blades are sharp and can cut.

            "### DANGER\n\nThis machine was built to be operated according to the safe operation practices in this manual. As with any type of power equipment, carelessness or error on the part of the operator can result in serious injury. This machine is capable of amputating fingers, hands, toes and feet and throwing objects. Failure to observe the following safety instructions could result in serious injury or death.\n\n### General Operation",
            "1. Read this operator's manual carefully in its entirety before attempting to assemble this machine. Read, understand, and follow all instructions on the machine and in the manual(s) before operation. Keep this manual in a safe place for future and regular reference and for ordering replacement parts.\n2. Be completely familiar with the controls and the proper use of this machine before operating it.\n3. This machine is a precision piece of power equipment, not a plaything. Therefore, exercise extreme caution at all times. This machine has been designed to perform one job: to mow grass. Do not use it for any other purpose.\n4. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and should be trained and supervised by an adult.\n5. Only responsible individuals who are familiar with these rules of safe operation should be allowed to use this machine.\n6. Thoroughly inspect the area where the equipment is to be used. Remove all stones, sticks, wire, bones, toys and other foreign objects, which could be tripped over or picked up and thrown by the blade. Thrown objects can cause serious personal injury.\n7. Plan your mowing pattern to avoid discharge of material toward roads, sidewalks, bystanders and the like. Also, avoid discharging material against a wall or obstruction, which may cause discharged material to ricochet back toward the operator.\n8. To help avoid blade contact or a thrown object injury, stay in operator zone behind handles and keep children, bystanders, helpers and pets at least 75 feet from mower while it is in operation. Stop machine if anyone enters area.\n9. Always wear safety glasses or safety goggles during operation and while performing an adjustment or repair to protect your eyes. Thrown objects which ricochet can cause serious injury to the eyes.\n10. Wear sturdy, rough-soled work shoes and close-fitting slacks and shirts. Shirts and pants that cover the arms and legs and steel-toed shoes are recommended. Never operate this machine in bare feet, sandals, slippery or lightweight (e.g., canvas) shoes.\n11. Do not put hands or feet near rotating parts or under the cutting deck. Contact with blade can amputate fingers, hands, toes and feet.\n12. A missing or damaged discharge cover can cause blade contact or thrown object injuries.\n13. Many injuries occur as a result of the mower being pulled over the foot during a fall caused by slipping or tripping. Do not hold onto the mower if you are falling; release the handle immediately.\n14. Never pull the mower back toward you while you are walking. If you must back the mower away from a wall or obstruction first look down and behind to avoid tripping and then follow these steps:\n    - Step back from mower to fully extend your arms.\n    - Be sure you are well balanced with sure footing.\n    - Pull the mower back slowly, no more than halfway toward you.\n    - Repeat these steps as needed.\n15. Do not operate the mower while under the influence of alcohol or drugs.\n16. Do not engage the self-propelled mechanism on machines so equipped while starting engine.\n17. The blade control is a safety device. Never attempt to bypass its operation. Doing so makes the safety device inoperative and may result in personal injury through contact with the rotating blade. The blade control must operate easily in both directions and automatically return to the disengaged position when released.\n18. Never operate the mower in wet grass. Always be sure of your footing. A slip and fall can cause serious personal injury. If you feel you are losing your footing, release the blade control handle immediately and the blade will stop rotating within three seconds.\n19. Mow only in daylight or good artificial light. Walk, never run.\n20. Stop the blade when crossing gravel drives, walks or roads.\n21. If the equipment should start to vibrate abnormally, stop the engine and check immediately for the cause. Vibration is generally a warning of trouble.\n22. Shut the engine off and wait until the blade comes to a complete stop before removing the grass catcher or unclogging the chute. The cutting blade continues to rotate for a few seconds after the blade control is released. Never place any part of the body in the blade area until you are sure the blade has stopped rotating.\n23. Never operate mower without proper trail shield, discharge cover, grass catcher, blade control or other safety protective devices in place and working. Never operate mower with damaged safety devices. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.\n24. Muffler and engine become hot and can cause a burn. Do not touch.\n25. Never attempt to make a wheel or cutting height adjustment while the engine is running.\n26. Only use parts and accessories made for this machine by the manufacturer. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.",
            "27. When starting engine, pull cord slowly until resistance is felt, then pull rapidly. Rapid retraction of starter cord (kickback) will pull hand and arm toward engine faster than you can let go. Broken bones, fractures, bruises or sprains could result.\n28. If situations occur which are not covered in this manual, use care and good judgment. Contact Customer Support for assistance and the name of your nearest servicing dealer.",
            "### Children\n\nTragic accidents can occur if the operator is not alert to the presence of children. Children are often attracted to the mower and the mowing activity. They do not understand the dangers. Never assume that children will remain where you last saw them.\n\n1. Keep children out of the mowing area and under watchful care of a responsible adult other than the operator.\n2. Be alert and turn mower off if a child enters the area.\n3. Before and while moving backwards, look behind and down for small children.\n4. Use extreme care when approaching blind corners, doorways, shrubs, trees, or other objects that may block your vision of a child who may run into the mower.\n5. Keep children away from hot or running engines. They can suffer burns from a hot muffler.\n6. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and be trained and supervised by an adult.\n\n### Service\n\nSafe Handling of Gasoline\n\nTo avoid personal injury or property damage, use extreme care in handling gasoline. Gasoline is extremely flammable and the vapors are explosive. Serious personal injury can occur when gasoline is spilled on yourself or your clothes, which can ignite. Wash your skin and change clothes immediately.\n\n1. Use only an approved gasoline container.\n2. Never fill containers inside a vehicle or on a truck or trailer bed with a plastic liner. Always place containers on the ground away from your vehicle before filling.\n3. Remove gas-powered equipment from the truck or trailer and refuel it on the ground. If this is not possible, then refuel such equipment on a trailer with a portable container, rather than from a gasoline dispenser nozzle.\n4. Keep the nozzle in contact with the rim of the fuel tank or container opening at all times until fueling is complete. Do not use a nozzle lock-open device.\n5. Extinguish all cigarettes, cigars, pipes and other sources of ignition.\n6. Never fuel machine indoors because flammable vapors will accumulate in the area.\n7. Never remove gas cap or add fuel while the engine is hot or running. Allow engine to cool at least two minutes before refueling.\n8. Never overfill fuel tank. Fill tank to no more than \u00bd inch below bottom of filler neck to provide space for fuel expansion.\n9. Replace gasoline cap and tighten securely.\n10. If gasoline is spilled, wipe it off the engine and equipment. Move machine to another area. Wait 5 minutes before starting engine.\n11. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light (e.g. furnace, water heater, space heater, clothes dryer, etc.).\n12. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n13. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light such as a water heater, furnace, clothes dryer etc.\n14. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n\n---\n\n## General Service\n\n1. Never run an engine indoors or in a poorly ventilated area. Engine exhaust contains carbon monoxide, an odorless and deadly gas.\n2. Before cleaning, repairing, or inspecting, make certain the blade and all moving parts have stopped. Disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine to prevent unintended starting.\n3. Check the blade and engine mounting bolts at frequent intervals for proper tightness. Also, visually inspect blade for damage (e.g., bent, cracked, worn). Replace blade with the original equipment manufacturer\u2019s (O.E.M.) blade only, listed in this manual. \u201cUse of parts which do not meet the original equipment specifications may lead to improper performance and compromise safety!\u201d\n4. Mower blades are sharp and can cut. Wrap the blade or wear gloves, and use extra caution when servicing them.\n5. Keep all nuts, bolts, and screws tight to be sure the equipment is in safe working condition.\n6. Never tamper with safety devices. Check their proper operation regularly.\n7. After striking a foreign object, stop the engine, disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine. Thoroughly inspect the mower for any damage. Repair the damage before starting and operating the mower.\n8. Never attempt to make adjustments or repairs to the mower while the engine is running.\n9. Grass catcher components are subject to wear, damage and deterioration, which could expose moving parts or allow objects to be thrown. Frequently check components and replace with the manufacturer\u2019s recommended parts when necessary.\n10. Mower blades are sharp and can cut.

            "### DANGER\n\nThis machine was built to be operated according to the safe operation practices in this manual. As with any type of power equipment, carelessness or error on the part of the operator can result in serious injury. This machine is capable of amputating fingers, hands, toes and feet and throwing objects. Failure to observe the following safety instructions could result in serious injury or death.\n\n### General Operation",
            "1. Read this operator's manual carefully in its entirety before attempting to assemble this machine. Read, understand, and follow all instructions on the machine and in the manual(s) before operation. Keep this manual in a safe place for future and regular reference and for ordering replacement parts.\n2. Be completely familiar with the controls and the proper use of this machine before operating it.\n3. This machine is a precision piece of power equipment, not a plaything. Therefore, exercise extreme caution at all times. This machine has been designed to perform one job: to mow grass. Do not use it for any other purpose.\n4. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and should be trained and supervised by an adult.\n5. Only responsible individuals who are familiar with these rules of safe operation should be allowed to use this machine.\n6. Thoroughly inspect the area where the equipment is to be used. Remove all stones, sticks, wire, bones, toys and other foreign objects, which could be tripped over or picked up and thrown by the blade. Thrown objects can cause serious personal injury.\n7. Plan your mowing pattern to avoid discharge of material toward roads, sidewalks, bystanders and the like. Also, avoid discharging material against a wall or obstruction, which may cause discharged material to ricochet back toward the operator.\n8. To help avoid blade contact or a thrown object injury, stay in operator zone behind handles and keep children, bystanders, helpers and pets at least 75 feet from mower while it is in operation. Stop machine if anyone enters area.\n9. Always wear safety glasses or safety goggles during operation and while performing an adjustment or repair to protect your eyes. Thrown objects which ricochet can cause serious injury to the eyes.\n10. Wear sturdy, rough-soled work shoes and close-fitting slacks and shirts. Shirts and pants that cover the arms and legs and steel-toed shoes are recommended. Never operate this machine in bare feet, sandals, slippery or lightweight (e.g., canvas) shoes.\n11. Do not put hands or feet near rotating parts or under the cutting deck. Contact with blade can amputate fingers, hands, toes and feet.\n12. A missing or damaged discharge cover can cause blade contact or thrown object injuries.\n13. Many injuries occur as a result of the mower being pulled over the foot during a fall caused by slipping or tripping. Do not hold onto the mower if you are falling; release the handle immediately.\n14. Never pull the mower back toward you while you are walking. If you must back the mower away from a wall or obstruction first look down and behind to avoid tripping and then follow these steps:\n    - Step back from mower to fully extend your arms.\n    - Be sure you are well balanced with sure footing.\n    - Pull the mower back slowly, no more than halfway toward you.\n    - Repeat these steps as needed.\n15. Do not operate the mower while under the influence of alcohol or drugs.\n16. Do not engage the self-propelled mechanism on machines so equipped while starting engine.\n17. The blade control is a safety device. Never attempt to bypass its operation. Doing so makes the safety device inoperative and may result in personal injury through contact with the rotating blade. The blade control must operate easily in both directions and automatically return to the disengaged position when released.\n18. Never operate the mower in wet grass. Always be sure of your footing. A slip and fall can cause serious personal injury. If you feel you are losing your footing, release the blade control handle immediately and the blade will stop rotating within three seconds.\n19. Mow only in daylight or good artificial light. Walk, never run.\n20. Stop the blade when crossing gravel drives, walks or roads.\n21. If the equipment should start to vibrate abnormally, stop the engine and check immediately for the cause. Vibration is generally a warning of trouble.\n22. Shut the engine off and wait until the blade comes to a complete stop before removing the grass catcher or unclogging the chute. The cutting blade continues to rotate for a few seconds after the blade control is released. Never place any part of the body in the blade area until you are sure the blade has stopped rotating.\n23. Never operate mower without proper trail shield, discharge cover, grass catcher, blade control or other safety protective devices in place and working. Never operate mower with damaged safety devices. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.\n24. Muffler and engine become hot and can cause a burn. Do not touch.\n25. Never attempt to make a wheel or cutting height adjustment while the engine is running.\n26. Only use parts and accessories made for this machine by the manufacturer. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.",
            "27. When starting engine, pull cord slowly until resistance is felt, then pull rapidly. Rapid retraction of starter cord (kickback) will pull hand and arm toward engine faster than you can let go. Broken bones, fractures, bruises or sprains could result.\n28. If situations occur which are not covered in this manual, use care and good judgment. Contact Customer Support for assistance and the name of your nearest servicing dealer.",
            "### Children\n\nTragic accidents can occur if the operator is not alert to the presence of children. Children are often attracted to the mower and the mowing activity. They do not understand the dangers. Never assume that children will remain where you last saw them.\n\n1. Keep children out of the mowing area and under watchful care of a responsible adult other than the operator.\n2. Be alert and turn mower off if a child enters the area.\n3. Before and while moving backwards, look behind and down for small children.\n4. Use extreme care when approaching blind corners, doorways, shrubs, trees, or other objects that may block your vision of a child who may run into the mower.\n5. Keep children away from hot or running engines. They can suffer burns from a hot muffler.\n6. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and be trained and supervised by an adult.\n\n### Service\n\nSafe Handling of Gasoline\n\nTo avoid personal injury or property damage, use extreme care in handling gasoline. Gasoline is extremely flammable and the vapors are explosive. Serious personal injury can occur when gasoline is spilled on yourself or your clothes, which can ignite. Wash your skin and change clothes immediately.\n\n1. Use only an approved gasoline container.\n2. Never fill containers inside a vehicle or on a truck or trailer bed with a plastic liner. Always place containers on the ground away from your vehicle before filling.\n3. Remove gas-powered equipment from the truck or trailer and refuel it on the ground. If this is not possible, then refuel such equipment on a trailer with a portable container, rather than from a gasoline dispenser nozzle.\n4. Keep the nozzle in contact with the rim of the fuel tank or container opening at all times until fueling is complete. Do not use a nozzle lock-open device.\n5. Extinguish all cigarettes, cigars, pipes and other sources of ignition.\n6. Never fuel machine indoors because flammable vapors will accumulate in the area.\n7. Never remove gas cap or add fuel while the engine is hot or running. Allow engine to cool at least two minutes before refueling.\n8. Never overfill fuel tank. Fill tank to no more than \u00bd inch below bottom of filler neck to provide space for fuel expansion.\n9. Replace gasoline cap and tighten securely.\n10. If gasoline is spilled, wipe it off the engine and equipment. Move machine to another area. Wait 5 minutes before starting engine.\n11. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light (e.g. furnace, water heater, space heater, clothes dryer, etc.).\n12. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n13. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light such as a water heater, furnace, clothes dryer etc.\n14. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n\n---\n\n## General Service\n\n1. Never run an engine indoors or in a poorly ventilated area. Engine exhaust contains carbon monoxide, an odorless and deadly gas.\n2. Before cleaning, repairing, or inspecting, make certain the blade and all moving parts have stopped. Disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine to prevent unintended starting.\n3. Check the blade and engine mounting bolts at frequent intervals for proper tightness. Also, visually inspect blade for damage (e.g., bent, cracked, worn). Replace blade with the original equipment manufacturer\u2019s (O.E.M.) blade only, listed in this manual. \u201cUse of parts which do not meet the original equipment specifications may lead to improper performance and compromise safety!\u201d\n4. Mower blades are sharp and can cut. Wrap the blade or wear gloves, and use extra caution when servicing them.\n5. Keep all nuts, bolts, and screws tight to be sure the equipment is in safe working condition.\n6. Never tamper with safety devices. Check their proper operation regularly.\n7. After striking a foreign object, stop the engine, disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine. Thoroughly inspect the mower for any damage. Repair the damage before starting and operating the mower.\n8. Never attempt to make adjustments or repairs to the mower while the engine is running.\n9. Grass catcher components are subject to wear, damage and deterioration, which could expose moving parts or allow objects to be thrown. Frequently check components and replace with the manufacturer\u2019s recommended parts when necessary.\n10. Mower blades are sharp and can cut. Wrap the blade or wear gloves, and use extra caution when servicing them.\n11. Do not change the engine governor setting or over-speed the engine.

            "### DANGER\n\nThis machine was built to be operated according to the safe operation practices in this manual. As with any type of power equipment, carelessness or error on the part of the operator can result in serious injury. This machine is capable of amputating fingers, hands, toes and feet and throwing objects. Failure to observe the following safety instructions could result in serious injury or death.\n\n### General Operation",
            "1. Read this operator's manual carefully in its entirety before attempting to assemble this machine. Read, understand, and follow all instructions on the machine and in the manual(s) before operation. Keep this manual in a safe place for future and regular reference and for ordering replacement parts.\n2. Be completely familiar with the controls and the proper use of this machine before operating it.\n3. This machine is a precision piece of power equipment, not a plaything. Therefore, exercise extreme caution at all times. This machine has been designed to perform one job: to mow grass. Do not use it for any other purpose.\n4. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and should be trained and supervised by an adult.\n5. Only responsible individuals who are familiar with these rules of safe operation should be allowed to use this machine.\n6. Thoroughly inspect the area where the equipment is to be used. Remove all stones, sticks, wire, bones, toys and other foreign objects, which could be tripped over or picked up and thrown by the blade. Thrown objects can cause serious personal injury.\n7. Plan your mowing pattern to avoid discharge of material toward roads, sidewalks, bystanders and the like. Also, avoid discharging material against a wall or obstruction, which may cause discharged material to ricochet back toward the operator.\n8. To help avoid blade contact or a thrown object injury, stay in operator zone behind handles and keep children, bystanders, helpers and pets at least 75 feet from mower while it is in operation. Stop machine if anyone enters area.\n9. Always wear safety glasses or safety goggles during operation and while performing an adjustment or repair to protect your eyes. Thrown objects which ricochet can cause serious injury to the eyes.\n10. Wear sturdy, rough-soled work shoes and close-fitting slacks and shirts. Shirts and pants that cover the arms and legs and steel-toed shoes are recommended. Never operate this machine in bare feet, sandals, slippery or lightweight (e.g., canvas) shoes.\n11. Do not put hands or feet near rotating parts or under the cutting deck. Contact with blade can amputate fingers, hands, toes and feet.\n12. A missing or damaged discharge cover can cause blade contact or thrown object injuries.\n13. Many injuries occur as a result of the mower being pulled over the foot during a fall caused by slipping or tripping. Do not hold onto the mower if you are falling; release the handle immediately.\n14. Never pull the mower back toward you while you are walking. If you must back the mower away from a wall or obstruction first look down and behind to avoid tripping and then follow these steps:\n    - Step back from mower to fully extend your arms.\n    - Be sure you are well balanced with sure footing.\n    - Pull the mower back slowly, no more than halfway toward you.\n    - Repeat these steps as needed.\n15. Do not operate the mower while under the influence of alcohol or drugs.\n16. Do not engage the self-propelled mechanism on machines so equipped while starting engine.\n17. The blade control is a safety device. Never attempt to bypass its operation. Doing so makes the safety device inoperative and may result in personal injury through contact with the rotating blade. The blade control must operate easily in both directions and automatically return to the disengaged position when released.\n18. Never operate the mower in wet grass. Always be sure of your footing. A slip and fall can cause serious personal injury. If you feel you are losing your footing, release the blade control handle immediately and the blade will stop rotating within three seconds.\n19. Mow only in daylight or good artificial light. Walk, never run.\n20. Stop the blade when crossing gravel drives, walks or roads.\n21. If the equipment should start to vibrate abnormally, stop the engine and check immediately for the cause. Vibration is generally a warning of trouble.\n22. Shut the engine off and wait until the blade comes to a complete stop before removing the grass catcher or unclogging the chute. The cutting blade continues to rotate for a few seconds after the blade control is released. Never place any part of the body in the blade area until you are sure the blade has stopped rotating.\n23. Never operate mower without proper trail shield, discharge cover, grass catcher, blade control or other safety protective devices in place and working. Never operate mower with damaged safety devices. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.\n24. Muffler and engine become hot and can cause a burn. Do not touch.\n25. Never attempt to make a wheel or cutting height adjustment while the engine is running.\n26. Only use parts and accessories made for this machine by the manufacturer. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.",
            "27. When starting engine, pull cord slowly until resistance is felt, then pull rapidly. Rapid retraction of starter cord (kickback) will pull hand and arm toward engine faster than you can let go. Broken bones, fractures, bruises or sprains could result.\n28. If situations occur which are not covered in this manual, use care and good judgment. Contact Customer Support for assistance and the name of your nearest servicing dealer.",
            "### Children\n\nTragic accidents can occur if the operator is not alert to the presence of children. Children are often attracted to the mower and the mowing activity. They do not understand the dangers. Never assume that children will remain where you last saw them.\n\n1. Keep children out of the mowing area and under watchful care of a responsible adult other than the operator.\n2. Be alert and turn mower off if a child enters the area.\n3. Before and while moving backwards, look behind and down for small children.\n4. Use extreme care when approaching blind corners, doorways, shrubs, trees, or other objects that may block your vision of a child who may run into the mower.\n5. Keep children away from hot or running engines. They can suffer burns from a hot muffler.\n6. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and be trained and supervised by an adult.\n\n### Service\n\nSafe Handling of Gasoline\n\nTo avoid personal injury or property damage, use extreme care in handling gasoline. Gasoline is extremely flammable and the vapors are explosive. Serious personal injury can occur when gasoline is spilled on yourself or your clothes, which can ignite. Wash your skin and change clothes immediately.\n\n1. Use only an approved gasoline container.\n2. Never fill containers inside a vehicle or on a truck or trailer bed with a plastic liner. Always place containers on the ground away from your vehicle before filling.\n3. Remove gas-powered equipment from the truck or trailer and refuel it on the ground. If this is not possible, then refuel such equipment on a trailer with a portable container, rather than from a gasoline dispenser nozzle.\n4. Keep the nozzle in contact with the rim of the fuel tank or container opening at all times until fueling is complete. Do not use a nozzle lock-open device.\n5. Extinguish all cigarettes, cigars, pipes and other sources of ignition.\n6. Never fuel machine indoors because flammable vapors will accumulate in the area.\n7. Never remove gas cap or add fuel while the engine is hot or running. Allow engine to cool at least two minutes before refueling.\n8. Never overfill fuel tank. Fill tank to no more than \u00bd inch below bottom of filler neck to provide space for fuel expansion.\n9. Replace gasoline cap and tighten securely.\n10. If gasoline is spilled, wipe it off the engine and equipment. Move machine to another area. Wait 5 minutes before starting engine.\n11. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light (e.g. furnace, water heater, space heater, clothes dryer, etc.).\n12. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n13. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light such as a water heater, furnace, clothes dryer etc.\n14. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n\n---\n\n## General Service\n\n1. Never run an engine indoors or in a poorly ventilated area. Engine exhaust contains carbon monoxide, an odorless and deadly gas.\n2. Before cleaning, repairing, or inspecting, make certain the blade and all moving parts have stopped. Disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine to prevent unintended starting.\n3. Check the blade and engine mounting bolts at frequent intervals for proper tightness. Also, visually inspect blade for damage (e.g., bent, cracked, worn). Replace blade with the original equipment manufacturer\u2019s (O.E.M.) blade only, listed in this manual. \u201cUse of parts which do not meet the original equipment specifications may lead to improper performance and compromise safety!\u201d\n4. Mower blades are sharp and can cut. Wrap the blade or wear gloves, and use extra caution when servicing them.\n5. Keep all nuts, bolts, and screws tight to be sure the equipment is in safe working condition.\n6. Never tamper with safety devices. Check their proper operation regularly.\n7. After striking a foreign object, stop the engine, disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine. Thoroughly inspect the mower for any damage. Repair the damage before starting and operating the mower.\n8. Never attempt to make adjustments or repairs to the mower while the engine is running.\n9. Grass catcher components are subject to wear, damage and deterioration, which could expose moving parts or allow objects to be thrown. Frequently check components and replace with the manufacturer\u2019s recommended parts when necessary.\n10. Mower blades are sharp and can cut.

            "### DANGER\n\nThis machine was built to be operated according to the safe operation practices in this manual. As with any type of power equipment, carelessness or error on the part of the operator can result in serious injury. This machine is capable of amputating fingers, hands, toes and feet and throwing objects. Failure to observe the following safety instructions could result in serious injury or death.\n\n### General Operation",
            "1. Read this operator's manual carefully in its entirety before attempting to assemble this machine. Read, understand, and follow all instructions on the machine and in the manual(s) before operation. Keep this manual in a safe place for future and regular reference and for ordering replacement parts.\n2. Be completely familiar with the controls and the proper use of this machine before operating it.\n3. This machine is a precision piece of power equipment, not a plaything. Therefore, exercise extreme caution at all times. This machine has been designed to perform one job: to mow grass. Do not use it for any other purpose.\n4. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and should be trained and supervised by an adult.\n5. Only responsible individuals who are familiar with these rules of safe operation should be allowed to use this machine.\n6. Thoroughly inspect the area where the equipment is to be used. Remove all stones, sticks, wire, bones, toys and other foreign objects, which could be tripped over or picked up and thrown by the blade. Thrown objects can cause serious personal injury.\n7. Plan your mowing pattern to avoid discharge of material toward roads, sidewalks, bystanders and the like. Also, avoid discharging material against a wall or obstruction, which may cause discharged material to ricochet back toward the operator.\n8. To help avoid blade contact or a thrown object injury, stay in operator zone behind handles and keep children, bystanders, helpers and pets at least 75 feet from mower while it is in operation. Stop machine if anyone enters area.\n9. Always wear safety glasses or safety goggles during operation and while performing an adjustment or repair to protect your eyes. Thrown objects which ricochet can cause serious injury to the eyes.\n10. Wear sturdy, rough-soled work shoes and close-fitting slacks and shirts. Shirts and pants that cover the arms and legs and steel-toed shoes are recommended. Never operate this machine in bare feet, sandals, slippery or lightweight (e.g., canvas) shoes.\n11. Do not put hands or feet near rotating parts or under the cutting deck. Contact with blade can amputate fingers, hands, toes and feet.\n12. A missing or damaged discharge cover can cause blade contact or thrown object injuries.\n13. Many injuries occur as a result of the mower being pulled over the foot during a fall caused by slipping or tripping. Do not hold onto the mower if you are falling; release the handle immediately.\n14. Never pull the mower back toward you while you are walking. If you must back the mower away from a wall or obstruction first look down and behind to avoid tripping and then follow these steps:\n    - Step back from mower to fully extend your arms.\n    - Be sure you are well balanced with sure footing.\n    - Pull the mower back slowly, no more than halfway toward you.\n    - Repeat these steps as needed.\n15. Do not operate the mower while under the influence of alcohol or drugs.\n16. Do not engage the self-propelled mechanism on machines so equipped while starting engine.\n17. The blade control is a safety device. Never attempt to bypass its operation. Doing so makes the safety device inoperative and may result in personal injury through contact with the rotating blade. The blade control must operate easily in both directions and automatically return to the disengaged position when released.\n18. Never operate the mower in wet grass. Always be sure of your footing. A slip and fall can cause serious personal injury. If you feel you are losing your footing, release the blade control handle immediately and the blade will stop rotating within three seconds.\n19. Mow only in daylight or good artificial light. Walk, never run.\n20. Stop the blade when crossing gravel drives, walks or roads.\n21. If the equipment should start to vibrate abnormally, stop the engine and check immediately for the cause. Vibration is generally a warning of trouble.\n22. Shut the engine off and wait until the blade comes to a complete stop before removing the grass catcher or unclogging the chute. The cutting blade continues to rotate for a few seconds after the blade control is released. Never place any part of the body in the blade area until you are sure the blade has stopped rotating.\n23. Never operate mower without proper trail shield, discharge cover, grass catcher, blade control or other safety protective devices in place and working. Never operate mower with damaged safety devices. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.\n24. Muffler and engine become hot and can cause a burn. Do not touch.\n25. Never attempt to make a wheel or cutting height adjustment while the engine is running.\n26. Only use parts and accessories made for this machine by the manufacturer. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.",
            "27. When starting engine, pull cord slowly until resistance is felt, then pull rapidly. Rapid retraction of starter cord (kickback) will pull hand and arm toward engine faster than you can let go. Broken bones, fractures, bruises or sprains could result.\n28. If situations occur which are not covered in this manual, use care and good judgment. Contact Customer Support for assistance and the name of your nearest servicing dealer.",
            "### Children\n\nTragic accidents can occur if the operator is not alert to the presence of children. Children are often attracted to the mower and the mowing activity. They do not understand the dangers. Never assume that children will remain where you last saw them.\n\n1. Keep children out of the mowing area and under watchful care of a responsible adult other than the operator.\n2. Be alert and turn mower off if a child enters the area.\n3. Before and while moving backwards, look behind and down for small children.\n4. Use extreme care when approaching blind corners, doorways, shrubs, trees, or other objects that may block your vision of a child who may run into the mower.\n5. Keep children away from hot or running engines. They can suffer burns from a hot muffler.\n6. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and be trained and supervised by an adult.\n\n### Service\n\nSafe Handling of Gasoline\n\nTo avoid personal injury or property damage, use extreme care in handling gasoline. Gasoline is extremely flammable and the vapors are explosive. Serious personal injury can occur when gasoline is spilled on yourself or your clothes, which can ignite. Wash your skin and change clothes immediately.\n\n1. Use only an approved gasoline container.\n2. Never fill containers inside a vehicle or on a truck or trailer bed with a plastic liner. Always place containers on the ground away from your vehicle before filling.\n3. Remove gas-powered equipment from the truck or trailer and refuel it on the ground. If this is not possible, then refuel such equipment on a trailer with a portable container, rather than from a gasoline dispenser nozzle.\n4. Keep the nozzle in contact with the rim of the fuel tank or container opening at all times until fueling is complete. Do not use a nozzle lock-open device.\n5. Extinguish all cigarettes, cigars, pipes and other sources of ignition.\n6. Never fuel machine indoors because flammable vapors will accumulate in the area.\n7. Never remove gas cap or add fuel while the engine is hot or running. Allow engine to cool at least two minutes before refueling.\n8. Never overfill fuel tank. Fill tank to no more than \u00bd inch below bottom of filler neck to provide space for fuel expansion.\n9. Replace gasoline cap and tighten securely.\n10. If gasoline is spilled, wipe it off the engine and equipment. Move machine to another area. Wait 5 minutes before starting engine.\n11. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light (e.g. furnace, water heater, space heater, clothes dryer, etc.).\n12. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n13. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light such as a water heater, furnace, clothes dryer etc.\n14. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n\n---\n\n## General Service\n\n1. Never run an engine indoors or in a poorly ventilated area. Engine exhaust contains carbon monoxide, an odorless and deadly gas.\n2. Before cleaning, repairing, or inspecting, make certain the blade and all moving parts have stopped. Disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine to prevent unintended starting.\n3. Check the blade and engine mounting bolts at frequent intervals for proper tightness. Also, visually inspect blade for damage (e.g., bent, cracked, worn). Replace blade with the original equipment manufacturer\u2019s (O.E.M.) blade only, listed in this manual. \u201cUse of parts which do not meet the original equipment specifications may lead to improper performance and compromise safety!\u201d\n4. Mower blades are sharp and can cut. Wrap the blade or wear gloves, and use extra caution when servicing them.\n5. Keep all nuts, bolts, and screws tight to be sure the equipment is in safe working condition.\n6. Never tamper with safety devices. Check their proper operation regularly.\n7. After striking a foreign object, stop the engine, disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine. Thoroughly inspect the mower for any damage. Repair the damage before starting and operating the mower.\n8. Never attempt to make adjustments or repairs to the mower while the engine is running.\n9. Grass catcher components are subject to wear, damage and deterioration, which could expose moving parts or allow objects to be thrown. Frequently check components and replace with the manufacturer\u2019s recommended parts when necessary.\n10. Mower blades are sharp and can cut. Wrap the blade or wear gloves, and use extra caution when servicing them.\n11. Do not change the engine governor setting or over-speed the engine.

            "### DANGER\n\nThis machine was built to be operated according to the safe operation practices in this manual. As with any type of power equipment, carelessness or error on the part of the operator can result in serious injury. This machine is capable of amputating fingers, hands, toes and feet and throwing objects. Failure to observe the following safety instructions could result in serious injury or death.\n\n### General Operation",
            "1. Read this operator's manual carefully in its entirety before attempting to assemble this machine. Read, understand, and follow all instructions on the machine and in the manual(s) before operation. Keep this manual in a safe place for future and regular reference and for ordering replacement parts.\n2. Be completely familiar with the controls and the proper use of this machine before operating it.\n3. This machine is a precision piece of power equipment, not a plaything. Therefore, exercise extreme caution at all times. This machine has been designed to perform one job: to mow grass. Do not use it for any other purpose.\n4. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and should be trained and supervised by an adult.\n5. Only responsible individuals who are familiar with these rules of safe operation should be allowed to use this machine.\n6. Thoroughly inspect the area where the equipment is to be used. Remove all stones, sticks, wire, bones, toys and other foreign objects, which could be tripped over or picked up and thrown by the blade. Thrown objects can cause serious personal injury.\n7. Plan your mowing pattern to avoid discharge of material toward roads, sidewalks, bystanders and the like. Also, avoid discharging material against a wall or obstruction, which may cause discharged material to ricochet back toward the operator.\n8. To help avoid blade contact or a thrown object injury, stay in operator zone behind handles and keep children, bystanders, helpers and pets at least 75 feet from mower while it is in operation. Stop machine if anyone enters area.\n9. Always wear safety glasses or safety goggles during operation and while performing an adjustment or repair to protect your eyes. Thrown objects which ricochet can cause serious injury to the eyes.\n10. Wear sturdy, rough-soled work shoes and close-fitting slacks and shirts. Shirts and pants that cover the arms and legs and steel-toed shoes are recommended. Never operate this machine in bare feet, sandals, slippery or lightweight (e.g., canvas) shoes.\n11. Do not put hands or feet near rotating parts or under the cutting deck. Contact with blade can amputate fingers, hands, toes and feet.\n12. A missing or damaged discharge cover can cause blade contact or thrown object injuries.\n13. Many injuries occur as a result of the mower being pulled over the foot during a fall caused by slipping or tripping. Do not hold onto the mower if you are falling; release the handle immediately.\n14. Never pull the mower back toward you while you are walking. If you must back the mower away from a wall or obstruction first look down and behind to avoid tripping and then follow these steps:\n    - Step back from mower to fully extend your arms.\n    - Be sure you are well balanced with sure footing.\n    - Pull the mower back slowly, no more than halfway toward you.\n    - Repeat these steps as needed.\n15. Do not operate the mower while under the influence of alcohol or drugs.\n16. Do not engage the self-propelled mechanism on machines so equipped while starting engine.\n17. The blade control is a safety device. Never attempt to bypass its operation. Doing so makes the safety device inoperative and may result in personal injury through contact with the rotating blade. The blade control must operate easily in both directions and automatically return to the disengaged position when released.\n18. Never operate the mower in wet grass. Always be sure of your footing. A slip and fall can cause serious personal injury. If you feel you are losing your footing, release the blade control handle immediately and the blade will stop rotating within three seconds.\n19. Mow only in daylight or good artificial light. Walk, never run.\n20. Stop the blade when crossing gravel drives, walks or roads.\n21. If the equipment should start to vibrate abnormally, stop the engine and check immediately for the cause. Vibration is generally a warning of trouble.\n22. Shut the engine off and wait until the blade comes to a complete stop before removing the grass catcher or unclogging the chute. The cutting blade continues to rotate for a few seconds after the blade control is released. Never place any part of the body in the blade area until you are sure the blade has stopped rotating.\n23. Never operate mower without proper trail shield, discharge cover, grass catcher, blade control or other safety protective devices in place and working. Never operate mower with damaged safety devices. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.\n24. Muffler and engine become hot and can cause a burn. Do not touch.\n25. Never attempt to make a wheel or cutting height adjustment while the engine is running.\n26. Only use parts and accessories made for this machine by the manufacturer. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.",
            "27. When starting engine, pull cord slowly until resistance is felt, then pull rapidly. Rapid retraction of starter cord (kickback) will pull hand and arm toward engine faster than you can let go. Broken bones, fractures, bruises or sprains could result.\n28. If situations occur which are not covered in this manual, use care and good judgment. Contact Customer Support for assistance and the name of your nearest servicing dealer.",
            "### Children\n\nTragic accidents can occur if the operator is not alert to the presence of children. Children are often attracted to the mower and the mowing activity. They do not understand the dangers. Never assume that children will remain where you last saw them.\n\n1. Keep children out of the mowing area and under watchful care of a responsible adult other than the operator.\n2. Be alert and turn mower off if a child enters the area.\n3. Before and while moving backwards, look behind and down for small children.\n4. Use extreme care when approaching blind corners, doorways, shrubs, trees, or other objects that may block your vision of a child who may run into the mower.\n5. Keep children away from hot or running engines. They can suffer burns from a hot muffler.\n6. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and be trained and supervised by an adult.\n\n### Service\n\nSafe Handling of Gasoline\n\nTo avoid personal injury or property damage, use extreme care in handling gasoline. Gasoline is extremely flammable and the vapors are explosive. Serious personal injury can occur when gasoline is spilled on yourself or your clothes, which can ignite. Wash your skin and change clothes immediately.\n\n1. Use only an approved gasoline container.\n2. Never fill containers inside a vehicle or on a truck or trailer bed with a plastic liner. Always place containers on the ground away from your vehicle before filling.\n3. Remove gas-powered equipment from the truck or trailer and refuel it on the ground. If this is not possible, then refuel such equipment on a trailer with a portable container, rather than from a gasoline dispenser nozzle.\n4. Keep the nozzle in contact with the rim of the fuel tank or container opening at all times until fueling is complete. Do not use a nozzle lock-open device.\n5. Extinguish all cigarettes, cigars, pipes and other sources of ignition.\n6. Never fuel machine indoors because flammable vapors will accumulate in the area.\n7. Never remove gas cap or add fuel while the engine is hot or running. Allow engine to cool at least two minutes before refueling.\n8. Never overfill fuel tank. Fill tank to no more than \u00bd inch below bottom of filler neck to provide space for fuel expansion.\n9. Replace gasoline cap and tighten securely.\n10. If gasoline is spilled, wipe it off the engine and equipment. Move machine to another area. Wait 5 minutes before starting engine.\n11. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light (e.g. furnace, water heater, space heater, clothes dryer, etc.).\n12. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n13. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light such as a water heater, furnace, clothes dryer etc.\n14. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n\n---\n\n## General Service\n\n1. Never run an engine indoors or in a poorly ventilated area. Engine exhaust contains carbon monoxide, an odorless and deadly gas.\n2. Before cleaning, repairing, or inspecting, make certain the blade and all moving parts have stopped. Disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine to prevent unintended starting.\n3. Check the blade and engine mounting bolts at frequent intervals for proper tightness. Also, visually inspect blade for damage (e.g., bent, cracked, worn). Replace blade with the original equipment manufacturer\u2019s (O.E.M.) blade only, listed in this manual. \u201cUse of parts which do not meet the original equipment specifications may lead to improper performance and compromise safety!\u201d\n4. Mower blades are sharp and can cut. Wrap the blade or wear gloves, and use extra caution when servicing them.\n5. Keep all nuts, bolts, and screws tight to be sure the equipment is in safe working condition.\n6. Never tamper with safety devices. Check their proper operation regularly.\n7. After striking a foreign object, stop the engine, disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine. Thoroughly inspect the mower for any damage. Repair the damage before starting and operating the mower.\n8. Never attempt to make adjustments or repairs to the mower while the engine is running.\n9. Grass catcher components are subject to wear, damage and deterioration, which could expose moving parts or allow objects to be thrown. Frequently check components and replace with the manufacturer\u2019s recommended parts when necessary.\n10. Mower blades are sharp and can cut.

            "### DANGER\n\nThis machine was built to be operated according to the safe operation practices in this manual. As with any type of power equipment, carelessness or error on the part of the operator can result in serious injury. This machine is capable of amputating fingers, hands, toes and feet and throwing objects. Failure to observe the following safety instructions could result in serious injury or death.\n\n### General Operation",
            "1. Read this operator's manual carefully in its entirety before attempting to assemble this machine. Read, understand, and follow all instructions on the machine and in the manual(s) before operation. Keep this manual in a safe place for future and regular reference and for ordering replacement parts.\n2. Be completely familiar with the controls and the proper use of this machine before operating it.\n3. This machine is a precision piece of power equipment, not a plaything. Therefore, exercise extreme caution at all times. This machine has been designed to perform one job: to mow grass. Do not use it for any other purpose.\n4. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and should be trained and supervised by an adult.\n5. Only responsible individuals who are familiar with these rules of safe operation should be allowed to use this machine.\n6. Thoroughly inspect the area where the equipment is to be used. Remove all stones, sticks, wire, bones, toys and other foreign objects, which could be tripped over or picked up and thrown by the blade. Thrown objects can cause serious personal injury.\n7. Plan your mowing pattern to avoid discharge of material toward roads, sidewalks, bystanders and the like. Also, avoid discharging material against a wall or obstruction, which may cause discharged material to ricochet back toward the operator.\n8. To help avoid blade contact or a thrown object injury, stay in operator zone behind handles and keep children, bystanders, helpers and pets at least 75 feet from mower while it is in operation. Stop machine if anyone enters area.\n9. Always wear safety glasses or safety goggles during operation and while performing an adjustment or repair to protect your eyes. Thrown objects which ricochet can cause serious injury to the eyes.\n10. Wear sturdy, rough-soled work shoes and close-fitting slacks and shirts. Shirts and pants that cover the arms and legs and steel-toed shoes are recommended. Never operate this machine in bare feet, sandals, slippery or lightweight (e.g., canvas) shoes.\n11. Do not put hands or feet near rotating parts or under the cutting deck. Contact with blade can amputate fingers, hands, toes and feet.\n12. A missing or damaged discharge cover can cause blade contact or thrown object injuries.\n13. Many injuries occur as a result of the mower being pulled over the foot during a fall caused by slipping or tripping. Do not hold onto the mower if you are falling; release the handle immediately.\n14. Never pull the mower back toward you while you are walking. If you must back the mower away from a wall or obstruction first look down and behind to avoid tripping and then follow these steps:\n    - Step back from mower to fully extend your arms.\n    - Be sure you are well balanced with sure footing.\n    - Pull the mower back slowly, no more than halfway toward you.\n    - Repeat these steps as needed.\n15. Do not operate the mower while under the influence of alcohol or drugs.\n16. Do not engage the self-propelled mechanism on machines so equipped while starting engine.\n17. The blade control is a safety device. Never attempt to bypass its operation. Doing so makes the safety device inoperative and may result in personal injury through contact with the rotating blade. The blade control must operate easily in both directions and automatically return to the disengaged position when released.\n18. Never operate the mower in wet grass. Always be sure of your footing. A slip and fall can cause serious personal injury. If you feel you are losing your footing, release the blade control handle immediately and the blade will stop rotating within three seconds.\n19. Mow only in daylight or good artificial light. Walk, never run.\n20. Stop the blade when crossing gravel drives, walks or roads.\n21. If the equipment should start to vibrate abnormally, stop the engine and check immediately for the cause. Vibration is generally a warning of trouble.\n22. Shut the engine off and wait until the blade comes to a complete stop before removing the grass catcher or unclogging the chute. The cutting blade continues to rotate for a few seconds after the blade control is released. Never place any part of the body in the blade area until you are sure the blade has stopped rotating.\n23. Never operate mower without proper trail shield, discharge cover, grass catcher, blade control or other safety protective devices in place and working. Never operate mower with damaged safety devices. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.\n24. Muffler and engine become hot and can cause a burn. Do not touch.\n25. Never attempt to make a wheel or cutting height adjustment while the engine is running.\n26. Only use parts and accessories made for this machine by the manufacturer. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.",
            "27. When starting engine, pull cord slowly until resistance is felt, then pull rapidly. Rapid retraction of starter cord (kickback) will pull hand and arm toward engine faster than you can let go. Broken bones, fractures, bruises or sprains could result.\n28. If situations occur which are not covered in this manual, use care and good judgment. Contact Customer Support for assistance and the name of your nearest servicing dealer.",
            "### Children\n\nTragic accidents can occur if the operator is not alert to the presence of children. Children are often attracted to the mower and the mowing activity. They do not understand the dangers. Never assume that children will remain where you last saw them.\n\n1. Keep children out of the mowing area and under watchful care of a responsible adult other than the operator.\n2. Be alert and turn mower off if a child enters the area.\n3. Before and while moving backwards, look behind and down for small children.\n4. Use extreme care when approaching blind corners, doorways, shrubs, trees, or other objects that may block your vision of a child who may run into the mower.\n5. Keep children away from hot or running engines. They can suffer burns from a hot muffler.\n6. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and be trained and supervised by an adult.\n\n### Service\n\nSafe Handling of Gasoline\n\nTo avoid personal injury or property damage, use extreme care in handling gasoline. Gasoline is extremely flammable and the vapors are explosive. Serious personal injury can occur when gasoline is spilled on yourself or your clothes, which can ignite. Wash your skin and change clothes immediately.\n\n1. Use only an approved gasoline container.\n2. Never fill containers inside a vehicle or on a truck or trailer bed with a plastic liner. Always place containers on the ground away from your vehicle before filling.\n3. Remove gas-powered equipment from the truck or trailer and refuel it on the ground. If this is not possible, then refuel such equipment on a trailer with a portable container, rather than from a gasoline dispenser nozzle.\n4. Keep the nozzle in contact with the rim of the fuel tank or container opening at all times until fueling is complete. Do not use a nozzle lock-open device.\n5. Extinguish all cigarettes, cigars, pipes and other sources of ignition.\n6. Never fuel machine indoors because flammable vapors will accumulate in the area.\n7. Never remove gas cap or add fuel while the engine is hot or running. Allow engine to cool at least two minutes before refueling.\n8. Never overfill fuel tank. Fill tank to no more than \u00bd inch below bottom of filler neck to provide space for fuel expansion.\n9. Replace gasoline cap and tighten securely.\n10. If gasoline is spilled, wipe it off the engine and equipment. Move machine to another area. Wait 5 minutes before starting engine.\n11. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light (e.g. furnace, water heater, space heater, clothes dryer, etc.).\n12. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n13. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light such as a water heater, furnace, clothes dryer etc.\n14. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n\n---\n\n## General Service\n\n1. Never run an engine indoors or in a poorly ventilated area. Engine exhaust contains carbon monoxide, an odorless and deadly gas.\n2. Before cleaning, repairing, or inspecting, make certain the blade and all moving parts have stopped. Disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine to prevent unintended starting.\n3. Check the blade and engine mounting bolts at frequent intervals for proper tightness. Also, visually inspect blade for damage (e.g., bent, cracked, worn). Replace blade with the original equipment manufacturer\u2019s (O.E.M.) blade only, listed in this manual. \u201cUse of parts which do not meet the original equipment specifications may lead to improper performance and compromise safety!\u201d\n4. Mower blades are sharp and can cut. Wrap the blade or wear gloves, and use extra caution when servicing them.\n5. Keep all nuts, bolts, and screws tight to be sure the equipment is in safe working condition.\n6. Never tamper with safety devices. Check their proper operation regularly.\n7. After striking a foreign object, stop the engine, disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine. Thoroughly inspect the mower for any damage. Repair the damage before starting and operating the mower.\n8. Never attempt to make adjustments or repairs to the mower while the engine is running.\n9. Grass catcher components are subject to wear, damage and deterioration, which could expose moving parts or allow objects to be thrown. Frequently check components and replace with the manufacturer\u2019s recommended parts when necessary.\n10. Mower blades are sharp and can cut.

            "### DANGER\n\nThis machine was built to be operated according to the safe operation practices in this manual. As with any type of power equipment, carelessness or error on the part of the operator can result in serious injury. This machine is capable of amputating fingers, hands, toes and feet and throwing objects. Failure to observe the following safety instructions could result in serious injury or death.\n\n### General Operation",
            "1. Read this operator's manual carefully in its entirety before attempting to assemble this machine. Read, understand, and follow all instructions on the machine and in the manual(s) before operation. Keep this manual in a safe place for future and regular reference and for ordering replacement parts.\n2. Be completely familiar with the controls and the proper use of this machine before operating it.\n3. This machine is a precision piece of power equipment, not a plaything. Therefore, exercise extreme caution at all times. This machine has been designed to perform one job: to mow grass. Do not use it for any other purpose.\n4. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and should be trained and supervised by an adult.\n5. Only responsible individuals who are familiar with these rules of safe operation should be allowed to use this machine.\n6. Thoroughly inspect the area where the equipment is to be used. Remove all stones, sticks, wire, bones, toys and other foreign objects, which could be tripped over or picked up and thrown by the blade. Thrown objects can cause serious personal injury.\n7. Plan your mowing pattern to avoid discharge of material toward roads, sidewalks, bystanders and the like. Also, avoid discharging material against a wall or obstruction, which may cause discharged material to ricochet back toward the operator.\n8. To help avoid blade contact or a thrown object injury, stay in operator zone behind handles and keep children, bystanders, helpers and pets at least 75 feet from mower while it is in operation. Stop machine if anyone enters area.\n9. Always wear safety glasses or safety goggles during operation and while performing an adjustment or repair to protect your eyes. Thrown objects which ricochet can cause serious injury to the eyes.\n10. Wear sturdy, rough-soled work shoes and close-fitting slacks and shirts. Shirts and pants that cover the arms and legs and steel-toed shoes are recommended. Never operate this machine in bare feet, sandals, slippery or lightweight (e.g., canvas) shoes.\n11. Do not put hands or feet near rotating parts or under the cutting deck. Contact with blade can amputate fingers, hands, toes and feet.\n12. A missing or damaged discharge cover can cause blade contact or thrown object injuries.\n13. Many injuries occur as a result of the mower being pulled over the foot during a fall caused by slipping or tripping. Do not hold onto the mower if you are falling; release the handle immediately.\n14. Never pull the mower back toward you while you are walking. If you must back the mower away from a wall or obstruction first look down and behind to avoid tripping and then follow these steps:\n    - Step back from mower to fully extend your arms.\n    - Be sure you are well balanced with sure footing.\n    - Pull the mower back slowly, no more than halfway toward you.\n    - Repeat these steps as needed.\n15. Do not operate the mower while under the influence of alcohol or drugs.\n16. Do not engage the self-propelled mechanism on machines so equipped while starting engine.\n17. The blade control is a safety device. Never attempt to bypass its operation. Doing so makes the safety device inoperative and may result in personal injury through contact with the rotating blade. The blade control must operate easily in both directions and automatically return to the disengaged position when released.\n18. Never operate the mower in wet grass. Always be sure of your footing. A slip and fall can cause serious personal injury. If you feel you are losing your footing, release the blade control handle immediately and the blade will stop rotating within three seconds.\n19. Mow only in daylight or good artificial light. Walk, never run.\n20. Stop the blade when crossing gravel drives, walks or roads.\n21. If the equipment should start to vibrate abnormally, stop the engine and check immediately for the cause. Vibration is generally a warning of trouble.\n22. Shut the engine off and wait until the blade comes to a complete stop before removing the grass catcher or unclogging the chute. The cutting blade continues to rotate for a few seconds after the blade control is released. Never place any part of the body in the blade area until you are sure the blade has stopped rotating.\n23. Never operate mower without proper trail shield, discharge cover, grass catcher, blade control or other safety protective devices in place and working. Never operate mower with damaged safety devices. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.\n24. Muffler and engine become hot and can cause a burn. Do not touch.\n25. Never attempt to make a wheel or cutting height adjustment while the engine is running.\n26. Only use parts and accessories made for this machine by the manufacturer. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.",
            "27. When starting engine, pull cord slowly until resistance is felt, then pull rapidly. Rapid retraction of starter cord (kickback) will pull hand and arm toward engine faster than you can let go. Broken bones, fractures, bruises or sprains could result.\n28. If situations occur which are not covered in this manual, use care and good judgment. Contact Customer Support for assistance and the name of your nearest servicing dealer.",
            "### Children\n\nTragic accidents can occur if the operator is not alert to the presence of children. Children are often attracted to the mower and the mowing activity. They do not understand the dangers. Never assume that children will remain where you last saw them.\n\n1. Keep children out of the mowing area and under watchful care of a responsible adult other than the operator.\n2. Be alert and turn mower off if a child enters the area.\n3. Before and while moving backwards, look behind and down for small children.\n4. Use extreme care when approaching blind corners, doorways, shrubs, trees, or other objects that may block your vision of a child who may run into the mower.\n5. Keep children away from hot or running engines. They can suffer burns from a hot muffler.\n6. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and be trained and supervised by an adult.\n\n### Service\n\nSafe Handling of Gasoline\n\nTo avoid personal injury or property damage, use extreme care in handling gasoline. Gasoline is extremely flammable and the vapors are explosive. Serious personal injury can occur when gasoline is spilled on yourself or your clothes, which can ignite. Wash your skin and change clothes immediately.\n\n1. Use only an approved gasoline container.\n2. Never fill containers inside a vehicle or on a truck or trailer bed with a plastic liner. Always place containers on the ground away from your vehicle before filling.\n3. Remove gas-powered equipment from the truck or trailer and refuel it on the ground. If this is not possible, then refuel such equipment on a trailer with a portable container, rather than from a gasoline dispenser nozzle.\n4. Keep the nozzle in contact with the rim of the fuel tank or container opening at all times until fueling is complete. Do not use a nozzle lock-open device.\n5. Extinguish all cigarettes, cigars, pipes and other sources of ignition.\n6. Never fuel machine indoors because flammable vapors will accumulate in the area.\n7. Never remove gas cap or add fuel while the engine is hot or running. Allow engine to cool at least two minutes before refueling.\n8. Never overfill fuel tank. Fill tank to no more than \u00bd inch below bottom of filler neck to provide space for fuel expansion.\n9. Replace gasoline cap and tighten securely.\n10. If gasoline is spilled, wipe it off the engine and equipment. Move machine to another area. Wait 5 minutes before starting engine.\n11. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light (e.g. furnace, water heater, space heater, clothes dryer, etc.).\n12. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n13. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light such as a water heater, furnace, clothes dryer etc.\n14. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n\n---\n\n## General Service\n\n1. Never run an engine indoors or in a poorly ventilated area. Engine exhaust contains carbon monoxide, an odorless and deadly gas.\n2. Before cleaning, repairing, or inspecting, make certain the blade and all moving parts have stopped. Disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine to prevent unintended starting.\n3. Check the blade and engine mounting bolts at frequent intervals for proper tightness. Also, visually inspect blade for damage (e.g., bent, cracked, worn). Replace blade with the original equipment manufacturer\u2019s (O.E.M.) blade only, listed in this manual. \u201cUse of parts which do not meet the original equipment specifications may lead to improper performance and compromise safety!\u201d\n4. Mower blades are sharp and can cut. Wrap the blade or wear gloves, and use extra caution when servicing them.\n5. Keep all nuts, bolts, and screws tight to be sure the equipment is in safe working condition.\n6. Never tamper with safety devices. Check their proper operation regularly.\n7. After striking a foreign object, stop the engine, disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine. Thoroughly inspect the mower for any damage. Repair the damage before starting and operating the mower.\n8. Never attempt to make adjustments or repairs to the mower while the engine is running.\n9. Grass catcher components are subject to wear, damage and deterioration, which could expose moving parts or allow objects to be thrown. Frequently check components and replace with the manufacturer\u2019s recommended parts when necessary.\n10. Mower blades are sharp and can cut. Wrap the blade or wear gloves, and use extra caution when servicing them.\n11. Do not change the engine governor setting or over-speed the engine.

            "### DANGER\n\nThis machine was built to be operated according to the safe operation practices in this manual. As with any type of power equipment, carelessness or error on the part of the operator can result in serious injury. This machine is capable of amputating fingers, hands, toes and feet and throwing objects. Failure to observe the following safety instructions could result in serious injury or death.\n\n### General Operation",
            "1. Read this operator's manual carefully in its entirety before attempting to assemble this machine. Read, understand, and follow all instructions on the machine and in the manual(s) before operation. Keep this manual in a safe place for future and regular reference and for ordering replacement parts.\n2. Be completely familiar with the controls and the proper use of this machine before operating it.\n3. This machine is a precision piece of power equipment, not a plaything. Therefore, exercise extreme caution at all times. This machine has been designed to perform one job: to mow grass. Do not use it for any other purpose.\n4. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and should be trained and supervised by an adult.\n5. Only responsible individuals who are familiar with these rules of safe operation should be allowed to use this machine.\n6. Thoroughly inspect the area where the equipment is to be used. Remove all stones, sticks, wire, bones, toys and other foreign objects, which could be tripped over or picked up and thrown by the blade. Thrown objects can cause serious personal injury.\n7. Plan your mowing pattern to avoid discharge of material toward roads, sidewalks, bystanders and the like. Also, avoid discharging material against a wall or obstruction, which may cause discharged material to ricochet back toward the operator.\n8. To help avoid blade contact or a thrown object injury, stay in operator zone behind handles and keep children, bystanders, helpers and pets at least 75 feet from mower while it is in operation. Stop machine if anyone enters area.\n9. Always wear safety glasses or safety goggles during operation and while performing an adjustment or repair to protect your eyes. Thrown objects which ricochet can cause serious injury to the eyes.\n10. Wear sturdy, rough-soled work shoes and close-fitting slacks and shirts. Shirts and pants that cover the arms and legs and steel-toed shoes are recommended. Never operate this machine in bare feet, sandals, slippery or lightweight (e.g., canvas) shoes.\n11. Do not put hands or feet near rotating parts or under the cutting deck. Contact with blade can amputate fingers, hands, toes and feet.\n12. A missing or damaged discharge cover can cause blade contact or thrown object injuries.\n13. Many injuries occur as a result of the mower being pulled over the foot during a fall caused by slipping or tripping. Do not hold onto the mower if you are falling; release the handle immediately.\n14. Never pull the mower back toward you while you are walking. If you must back the mower away from a wall or obstruction first look down and behind to avoid tripping and then follow these steps:\n    - Step back from mower to fully extend your arms.\n    - Be sure you are well balanced with sure footing.\n    - Pull the mower back slowly, no more than halfway toward you.\n    - Repeat these steps as needed.\n15. Do not operate the mower while under the influence of alcohol or drugs.\n16. Do not engage the self-propelled mechanism on machines so equipped while starting engine.\n17. The blade control is a safety device. Never attempt to bypass its operation. Doing so makes the safety device inoperative and may result in personal injury through contact with the rotating blade. The blade control must operate easily in both directions and automatically return to the disengaged position when released.\n18. Never operate the mower in wet grass. Always be sure of your footing. A slip and fall can cause serious personal injury. If you feel you are losing your footing, release the blade control handle immediately and the blade will stop rotating within three seconds.\n19. Mow only in daylight or good artificial light. Walk, never run.\n20. Stop the blade when crossing gravel drives, walks or roads.\n21. If the equipment should start to vibrate abnormally, stop the engine and check immediately for the cause. Vibration is generally a warning of trouble.\n22. Shut the engine off and wait until the blade comes to a complete stop before removing the grass catcher or unclogging the chute. The cutting blade continues to rotate for a few seconds after the blade control is released. Never place any part of the body in the blade area until you are sure the blade has stopped rotating.\n23. Never operate mower without proper trail shield, discharge cover, grass catcher, blade control or other safety protective devices in place and working. Never operate mower with damaged safety devices. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.\n24. Muffler and engine become hot and can cause a burn. Do not touch.\n25. Never attempt to make a wheel or cutting height adjustment while the engine is running.\n26. Only use parts and accessories made for this machine by the manufacturer. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.",
            "27. When starting engine, pull cord slowly until resistance is felt, then pull rapidly. Rapid retraction of starter cord (kickback) will pull hand and arm toward engine faster than you can let go. Broken bones, fractures, bruises or sprains could result.\n28. If situations occur which are not covered in this manual, use care and good judgment. Contact Customer Support for assistance and the name of your nearest servicing dealer.",
            "### Children\n\nTragic accidents can occur if the operator is not alert to the presence of children. Children are often attracted to the mower and the mowing activity. They do not understand the dangers. Never assume that children will remain where you last saw them.\n\n1. Keep children out of the mowing area and under watchful care of a responsible adult other than the operator.\n2. Be alert and turn mower off if a child enters the area.\n3. Before and while moving backwards, look behind and down for small children.\n4. Use extreme care when approaching blind corners, doorways, shrubs, trees, or other objects that may block your vision of a child who may run into the mower.\n5. Keep children away from hot or running engines. They can suffer burns from a hot muffler.\n6. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and be trained and supervised by an adult.\n\n### Service\n\nSafe Handling of Gasoline\n\nTo avoid personal injury or property damage, use extreme care in handling gasoline. Gasoline is extremely flammable and the vapors are explosive. Serious personal injury can occur when gasoline is spilled on yourself or your clothes, which can ignite. Wash your skin and change clothes immediately.\n\n1. Use only an approved gasoline container.\n2. Never fill containers inside a vehicle or on a truck or trailer bed with a plastic liner. Always place containers on the ground away from your vehicle before filling.\n3. Remove gas-powered equipment from the truck or trailer and refuel it on the ground. If this is not possible, then refuel such equipment on a trailer with a portable container, rather than from a gasoline dispenser nozzle.\n4. Keep the nozzle in contact with the rim of the fuel tank or container opening at all times until fueling is complete. Do not use a nozzle lock-open device.\n5. Extinguish all cigarettes, cigars, pipes and other sources of ignition.\n6. Never fuel machine indoors because flammable vapors will accumulate in the area.\n7. Never remove gas cap or add fuel while the engine is hot or running. Allow engine to cool at least two minutes before refueling.\n8. Never overfill fuel tank. Fill tank to no more than \u00bd inch below bottom of filler neck to provide space for fuel expansion.\n9. Replace gasoline cap and tighten securely.\n10. If gasoline is spilled, wipe it off the engine and equipment. Move machine to another area. Wait 5 minutes before starting engine.\n11. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light (e.g. furnace, water heater, space heater, clothes dryer, etc.).\n12. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n13. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light such as a water heater, furnace, clothes dryer etc.\n14. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n\n---\n\n## General Service\n\n1. Never run an engine indoors or in a poorly ventilated area. Engine exhaust contains carbon monoxide, an odorless and deadly gas.\n2. Before cleaning, repairing, or inspecting, make certain the blade and all moving parts have stopped. Disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine to prevent unintended starting.\n3. Check the blade and engine mounting bolts at frequent intervals for proper tightness. Also, visually inspect blade for damage (e.g., bent, cracked, worn). Replace blade with the original equipment manufacturer\u2019s (O.E.M.) blade only, listed in this manual. \u201cUse of parts which do not meet the original equipment specifications may lead to improper performance and compromise safety!\u201d\n4. Mower blades are sharp and can cut. Wrap the blade or wear gloves, and use extra caution when servicing them.\n5. Keep all nuts, bolts, and screws tight to be sure the equipment is in safe working condition.\n6. Never tamper with safety devices. Check their proper operation regularly.\n7. After striking a foreign object, stop the engine, disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine. Thoroughly inspect the mower for any damage. Repair the damage before starting and operating the mower.\n8. Never attempt to make adjustments or repairs to the mower while the engine is running.\n9. Grass catcher components are subject to wear, damage and deterioration, which could expose moving parts or allow objects to be thrown. Frequently check components and replace with the manufacturer\u2019s recommended parts when necessary.\n10. Mower blades are sharp and can cut.

            "### DANGER\n\nThis machine was built to be operated according to the safe operation practices in this manual. As with any type of power equipment, carelessness or error on the part of the operator can result in serious injury. This machine is capable of amputating fingers, hands, toes and feet and throwing objects. Failure to observe the following safety instructions could result in serious injury or death.\n\n### General Operation",
            "1. Read this operator's manual carefully in its entirety before attempting to assemble this machine. Read, understand, and follow all instructions on the machine and in the manual(s) before operation. Keep this manual in a safe place for future and regular reference and for ordering replacement parts.\n2. Be completely familiar with the controls and the proper use of this machine before operating it.\n3. This machine is a precision piece of power equipment, not a plaything. Therefore, exercise extreme caution at all times. This machine has been designed to perform one job: to mow grass. Do not use it for any other purpose.\n4. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and should be trained and supervised by an adult.\n5. Only responsible individuals who are familiar with these rules of safe operation should be allowed to use this machine.\n6. Thoroughly inspect the area where the equipment is to be used. Remove all stones, sticks, wire, bones, toys and other foreign objects, which could be tripped over or picked up and thrown by the blade. Thrown objects can cause serious personal injury.\n7. Plan your mowing pattern to avoid discharge of material toward roads, sidewalks, bystanders and the like. Also, avoid discharging material against a wall or obstruction, which may cause discharged material to ricochet back toward the operator.\n8. To help avoid blade contact or a thrown object injury, stay in operator zone behind handles and keep children, bystanders, helpers and pets at least 75 feet from mower while it is in operation. Stop machine if anyone enters area.\n9. Always wear safety glasses or safety goggles during operation and while performing an adjustment or repair to protect your eyes. Thrown objects which ricochet can cause serious injury to the eyes.\n10. Wear sturdy, rough-soled work shoes and close-fitting slacks and shirts. Shirts and pants that cover the arms and legs and steel-toed shoes are recommended. Never operate this machine in bare feet, sandals, slippery or lightweight (e.g., canvas) shoes.\n11. Do not put hands or feet near rotating parts or under the cutting deck. Contact with blade can amputate fingers, hands, toes and feet.\n12. A missing or damaged discharge cover can cause blade contact or thrown object injuries.\n13. Many injuries occur as a result of the mower being pulled over the foot during a fall caused by slipping or tripping. Do not hold onto the mower if you are falling; release the handle immediately.\n14. Never pull the mower back toward you while you are walking. If you must back the mower away from a wall or obstruction first look down and behind to avoid tripping and then follow these steps:\n    - Step back from mower to fully extend your arms.\n    - Be sure you are well balanced with sure footing.\n    - Pull the mower back slowly, no more than halfway toward you.\n    - Repeat these steps as needed.\n15. Do not operate the mower while under the influence of alcohol or drugs.\n16. Do not engage the self-propelled mechanism on machines so equipped while starting engine.\n17. The blade control is a safety device. Never attempt to bypass its operation. Doing so makes the safety device inoperative and may result in personal injury through contact with the rotating blade. The blade control must operate easily in both directions and automatically return to the disengaged position when released.\n18. Never operate the mower in wet grass. Always be sure of your footing. A slip and fall can cause serious personal injury. If you feel you are losing your footing, release the blade control handle immediately and the blade will stop rotating within three seconds.\n19. Mow only in daylight or good artificial light. Walk, never run.\n20. Stop the blade when crossing gravel drives, walks or roads.\n21. If the equipment should start to vibrate abnormally, stop the engine and check immediately for the cause. Vibration is generally a warning of trouble.\n22. Shut the engine off and wait until the blade comes to a complete stop before removing the grass catcher or unclogging the chute. The cutting blade continues to rotate for a few seconds after the blade control is released. Never place any part of the body in the blade area until you are sure the blade has stopped rotating.\n23. Never operate mower without proper trail shield, discharge cover, grass catcher, blade control or other safety protective devices in place and working. Never operate mower with damaged safety devices. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.\n24. Muffler and engine become hot and can cause a burn. Do not touch.\n25. Never attempt to make a wheel or cutting height adjustment while the engine is running.\n26. Only use parts and accessories made for this machine by the manufacturer. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.",
            "27. When starting engine, pull cord slowly until resistance is felt, then pull rapidly. Rapid retraction of starter cord (kickback) will pull hand and arm toward engine faster than you can let go. Broken bones, fractures, bruises or sprains could result.\n28. If situations occur which are not covered in this manual, use care and good judgment. Contact Customer Support for assistance and the name of your nearest servicing dealer.",
            "### Children\n\nTragic accidents can occur if the operator is not alert to the presence of children. Children are often attracted to the mower and the mowing activity. They do not understand the dangers. Never assume that children will remain where you last saw them.\n\n1. Keep children out of the mowing area and under watchful care of a responsible adult other than the operator.\n2. Be alert and turn mower off if a child enters the area.\n3. Before and while moving backwards, look behind and down for small children.\n4. Use extreme care when approaching blind corners, doorways, shrubs, trees, or other objects that may block your vision of a child who may run into the mower.\n5. Keep children away from hot or running engines. They can suffer burns from a hot muffler.\n6. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and be trained and supervised by an adult.\n\n### Service\n\nSafe Handling of Gasoline\n\nTo avoid personal injury or property damage, use extreme care in handling gasoline. Gasoline is extremely flammable and the vapors are explosive. Serious personal injury can occur when gasoline is spilled on yourself or your clothes, which can ignite. Wash your skin and change clothes immediately.\n\n1. Use only an approved gasoline container.\n2. Never fill containers inside a vehicle or on a truck or trailer bed with a plastic liner. Always place containers on the ground away from your vehicle before filling.\n3. Remove gas-powered equipment from the truck or trailer and refuel it on the ground. If this is not possible, then refuel such equipment on a trailer with a portable container, rather than from a gasoline dispenser nozzle.\n4. Keep the nozzle in contact with the rim of the fuel tank or container opening at all times until fueling is complete. Do not use a nozzle lock-open device.\n5. Extinguish all cigarettes, cigars, pipes and other sources of ignition.\n6. Never fuel machine indoors because flammable vapors will accumulate in the area.\n7. Never remove gas cap or add fuel while the engine is hot or running. Allow engine to cool at least two minutes before refueling.\n8. Never overfill fuel tank. Fill tank to no more than \u00bd inch below bottom of filler neck to provide space for fuel expansion.\n9. Replace gasoline cap and tighten securely.\n10. If gasoline is spilled, wipe it off the engine and equipment. Move machine to another area. Wait 5 minutes before starting engine.\n11. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light (e.g. furnace, water heater, space heater, clothes dryer, etc.).\n12. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n13. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light such as a water heater, furnace, clothes dryer etc.\n14. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n\n---\n\n## General Service\n\n1. Never run an engine indoors or in a poorly ventilated area. Engine exhaust contains carbon monoxide, an odorless and deadly gas.\n2. Before cleaning, repairing, or inspecting, make certain the blade and all moving parts have stopped. Disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine to prevent unintended starting.\n3. Check the blade and engine mounting bolts at frequent intervals for proper tightness. Also, visually inspect blade for damage (e.g., bent, cracked, worn). Replace blade with the original equipment manufacturer\u2019s (O.E.M.) blade only, listed in this manual. \u201cUse of parts which do not meet the original equipment specifications may lead to improper performance and compromise safety!\u201d\n4. Mower blades are sharp and can cut. Wrap the blade or wear gloves, and use extra caution when servicing them.\n5. Keep all nuts, bolts, and screws tight to be sure the equipment is in safe working condition.\n6. Never tamper with safety devices. Check their proper operation regularly.\n7. After striking a foreign object, stop the engine, disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine. Thoroughly inspect the mower for any damage. Repair the damage before starting and operating the mower.\n8. Never attempt to make adjustments or repairs to the mower while the engine is running.\n9. Grass catcher components are subject to wear, damage and deterioration, which could expose moving parts or allow objects to be thrown. Frequently check components and replace with the manufacturer\u2019s recommended parts when necessary.\n10. Mower blades are sharp and can cut.

            "### DANGER\n\nThis machine was built to be operated according to the safe operation practices in this manual. As with any type of power equipment, carelessness or error on the part of the operator can result in serious injury. This machine is capable of amputating fingers, hands, toes and feet and throwing objects. Failure to observe the following safety instructions could result in serious injury or death.\n\n### General Operation",
            "1. Read this operator's manual carefully in its entirety before attempting to assemble this machine. Read, understand, and follow all instructions on the machine and in the manual(s) before operation. Keep this manual in a safe place for future and regular reference and for ordering replacement parts.\n2. Be completely familiar with the controls and the proper use of this machine before operating it.\n3. This machine is a precision piece of power equipment, not a plaything. Therefore, exercise extreme caution at all times. This machine has been designed to perform one job: to mow grass. Do not use it for any other purpose.\n4. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and should be trained and supervised by an adult.\n5. Only responsible individuals who are familiar with these rules of safe operation should be allowed to use this machine.\n6. Thoroughly inspect the area where the equipment is to be used. Remove all stones, sticks, wire, bones, toys and other foreign objects, which could be tripped over or picked up and thrown by the blade. Thrown objects can cause serious personal injury.\n7. Plan your mowing pattern to avoid discharge of material toward roads, sidewalks, bystanders and the like. Also, avoid discharging material against a wall or obstruction, which may cause discharged material to ricochet back toward the operator.\n8. To help avoid blade contact or a thrown object injury, stay in operator zone behind handles and keep children, bystanders, helpers and pets at least 75 feet from mower while it is in operation. Stop machine if anyone enters area.\n9. Always wear safety glasses or safety goggles during operation and while performing an adjustment or repair to protect your eyes. Thrown objects which ricochet can cause serious injury to the eyes.\n10. Wear sturdy, rough-soled work shoes and close-fitting slacks and shirts. Shirts and pants that cover the arms and legs and steel-toed shoes are recommended. Never operate this machine in bare feet, sandals, slippery or lightweight (e.g., canvas) shoes.\n11. Do not put hands or feet near rotating parts or under the cutting deck. Contact with blade can amputate fingers, hands, toes and feet.\n12. A missing or damaged discharge cover can cause blade contact or thrown object injuries.\n13. Many injuries occur as a result of the mower being pulled over the foot during a fall caused by slipping or tripping. Do not hold onto the mower if you are falling; release the handle immediately.\n14. Never pull the mower back toward you while you are walking. If you must back the mower away from a wall or obstruction first look down and behind to avoid tripping and then follow these steps:\n    - Step back from mower to fully extend your arms.\n    - Be sure you are well balanced with sure footing.\n    - Pull the mower back slowly, no more than halfway toward you.\n    - Repeat these steps as needed.\n15. Do not operate the mower while under the influence of alcohol or drugs.\n16. Do not engage the self-propelled mechanism on machines so equipped while starting engine.\n17. The blade control is a safety device. Never attempt to bypass its operation. Doing so makes the safety device inoperative and may result in personal injury through contact with the rotating blade. The blade control must operate easily in both directions and automatically return to the disengaged position when released.\n18. Never operate the mower in wet grass. Always be sure of your footing. A slip and fall can cause serious personal injury. If you feel you are losing your footing, release the blade control handle immediately and the blade will stop rotating within three seconds.\n19. Mow only in daylight or good artificial light. Walk, never run.\n20. Stop the blade when crossing gravel drives, walks or roads.\n21. If the equipment should start to vibrate abnormally, stop the engine and check immediately for the cause. Vibration is generally a warning of trouble.\n22. Shut the engine off and wait until the blade comes to a complete stop before removing the grass catcher or unclogging the chute. The cutting blade continues to rotate for a few seconds after the blade control is released. Never place any part of the body in the blade area until you are sure the blade has stopped rotating.\n23. Never operate mower without proper trail shield, discharge cover, grass catcher, blade control or other safety protective devices in place and working. Never operate mower with damaged safety devices. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.\n24. Muffler and engine become hot and can cause a burn. Do not touch.\n25. Never attempt to make a wheel or cutting height adjustment while the engine is running.\n26. Only use parts and accessories made for this machine by the manufacturer. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.",
            "27. When starting engine, pull cord slowly until resistance is felt, then pull rapidly. Rapid retraction of starter cord (kickback) will pull hand and arm toward engine faster than you can let go. Broken bones, fractures, bruises or sprains could result.\n28. If situations occur which are not covered in this manual, use care and good judgment. Contact Customer Support for assistance and the name of your nearest servicing dealer.",
            "### Children\n\nTragic accidents can occur if the operator is not alert to the presence of children. Children are often attracted to the mower and the mowing activity. They do not understand the dangers. Never assume that children will remain where you last saw them.\n\n1. Keep children out of the mowing area and under watchful care of a responsible adult other than the operator.\n2. Be alert and turn mower off if a child enters the area.\n3. Before and while moving backwards, look behind and down for small children.\n4. Use extreme care when approaching blind corners, doorways, shrubs, trees, or other objects that may block your vision of a child who may run into the mower.\n5. Keep children away from hot or running engines. They can suffer burns from a hot muffler.\n6. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and be trained and supervised by an adult.\n\n### Service\n\nSafe Handling of Gasoline\n\nTo avoid personal injury or property damage, use extreme care in handling gasoline. Gasoline is extremely flammable and the vapors are explosive. Serious personal injury can occur when gasoline is spilled on yourself or your clothes, which can ignite. Wash your skin and change clothes immediately.\n\n1. Use only an approved gasoline container.\n2. Never fill containers inside a vehicle or on a truck or trailer bed with a plastic liner. Always place containers on the ground away from your vehicle before filling.\n3. Remove gas-powered equipment from the truck or trailer and refuel it on the ground. If this is not possible, then refuel such equipment on a trailer with a portable container, rather than from a gasoline dispenser nozzle.\n4. Keep the nozzle in contact with the rim of the fuel tank or container opening at all times until fueling is complete. Do not use a nozzle lock-open device.\n5. Extinguish all cigarettes, cigars, pipes and other sources of ignition.\n6. Never fuel machine indoors because flammable vapors will accumulate in the area.\n7. Never remove gas cap or add fuel while the engine is hot or running. Allow engine to cool at least two minutes before refueling.\n8. Never overfill fuel tank. Fill tank to no more than \u00bd inch below bottom of filler neck to provide space for fuel expansion.\n9. Replace gasoline cap and tighten securely.\n10. If gasoline is spilled, wipe it off the engine and equipment. Move machine to another area. Wait 5 minutes before starting engine.\n11. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light (e.g. furnace, water heater, space heater, clothes dryer, etc.).\n12. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n13. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light such as a water heater, furnace, clothes dryer etc.\n14. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n\n---\n\n## General Service\n\n1. Never run an engine indoors or in a poorly ventilated area. Engine exhaust contains carbon monoxide, an odorless and deadly gas.\n2. Before cleaning, repairing, or inspecting, make certain the blade and all moving parts have stopped. Disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine to prevent unintended starting.\n3. Check the blade and engine mounting bolts at frequent intervals for proper tightness. Also, visually inspect blade for damage (e.g., bent, cracked, worn). Replace blade with the original equipment manufacturer\u2019s (O.E.M.) blade only, listed in this manual. \u201cUse of parts which do not meet the original equipment specifications may lead to improper performance and compromise safety!\u201d\n4. Mower blades are sharp and can cut. Wrap the blade or wear gloves, and use extra caution when servicing them.\n5. Keep all nuts, bolts, and screws tight to be sure the equipment is in safe working condition.\n6. Never tamper with safety devices. Check their proper operation regularly.\n7. After striking a foreign object, stop the engine, disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine. Thoroughly inspect the mower for any damage. Repair the damage before starting and operating the mower.\n8. Never attempt to make adjustments or repairs to the mower while the engine is running.\n9. Grass catcher components are subject to wear, damage and deterioration, which could expose moving parts or allow objects to be thrown. Frequently check components and replace with the manufacturer\u2019s recommended parts when necessary.\n10. Mower blades are sharp and can cut.

            "### DANGER\n\nThis machine was built to be operated according to the safe operation practices in this manual. As with any type of power equipment, carelessness or error on the part of the operator can result in serious injury. This machine is capable of amputating fingers, hands, toes and feet and throwing objects. Failure to observe the following safety instructions could result in serious injury or death.\n\n### General Operation",
            "1. Read this operator's manual carefully in its entirety before attempting to assemble this machine. Read, understand, and follow all instructions on the machine and in the manual(s) before operation. Keep this manual in a safe place for future and regular reference and for ordering replacement parts.\n2. Be completely familiar with the controls and the proper use of this machine before operating it.\n3. This machine is a precision piece of power equipment, not a plaything. Therefore, exercise extreme caution at all times. This machine has been designed to perform one job: to mow grass. Do not use it for any other purpose.\n4. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and should be trained and supervised by an adult.\n5. Only responsible individuals who are familiar with these rules of safe operation should be allowed to use this machine.\n6. Thoroughly inspect the area where the equipment is to be used. Remove all stones, sticks, wire, bones, toys and other foreign objects, which could be tripped over or picked up and thrown by the blade. Thrown objects can cause serious personal injury.\n7. Plan your mowing pattern to avoid discharge of material toward roads, sidewalks, bystanders and the like. Also, avoid discharging material against a wall or obstruction, which may cause discharged material to ricochet back toward the operator.\n8. To help avoid blade contact or a thrown object injury, stay in operator zone behind handles and keep children, bystanders, helpers and pets at least 75 feet from mower while it is in operation. Stop machine if anyone enters area.\n9. Always wear safety glasses or safety goggles during operation and while performing an adjustment or repair to protect your eyes. Thrown objects which ricochet can cause serious injury to the eyes.\n10. Wear sturdy, rough-soled work shoes and close-fitting slacks and shirts. Shirts and pants that cover the arms and legs and steel-toed shoes are recommended. Never operate this machine in bare feet, sandals, slippery or lightweight (e.g., canvas) shoes.\n11. Do not put hands or feet near rotating parts or under the cutting deck. Contact with blade can amputate fingers, hands, toes and feet.\n12. A missing or damaged discharge cover can cause blade contact or thrown object injuries.\n13. Many injuries occur as a result of the mower being pulled over the foot during a fall caused by slipping or tripping. Do not hold onto the mower if you are falling; release the handle immediately.\n14. Never pull the mower back toward you while you are walking. If you must back the mower away from a wall or obstruction first look down and behind to avoid tripping and then follow these steps:\n    - Step back from mower to fully extend your arms.\n    - Be sure you are well balanced with sure footing.\n    - Pull the mower back slowly, no more than halfway toward you.\n    - Repeat these steps as needed.\n15. Do not operate the mower while under the influence of alcohol or drugs.\n16. Do not engage the self-propelled mechanism on machines so equipped while starting engine.\n17. The blade control is a safety device. Never attempt to bypass its operation. Doing so makes the safety device inoperative and may result in personal injury through contact with the rotating blade. The blade control must operate easily in both directions and automatically return to the disengaged position when released.\n18. Never operate the mower in wet grass. Always be sure of your footing. A slip and fall can cause serious personal injury. If you feel you are losing your footing, release the blade control handle immediately and the blade will stop rotating within three seconds.\n19. Mow only in daylight or good artificial light. Walk, never run.\n20. Stop the blade when crossing gravel drives, walks or roads.\n21. If the equipment should start to vibrate abnormally, stop the engine and check immediately for the cause. Vibration is generally a warning of trouble.\n22. Shut the engine off and wait until the blade comes to a complete stop before removing the grass catcher or unclogging the chute. The cutting blade continues to rotate for a few seconds after the blade control is released. Never place any part of the body in the blade area until you are sure the blade has stopped rotating.\n23. Never operate mower without proper trail shield, discharge cover, grass catcher, blade control or other safety protective devices in place and working. Never operate mower with damaged safety devices. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.\n24. Muffler and engine become hot and can cause a burn. Do not touch.\n25. Never attempt to make a wheel or cutting height adjustment while the engine is running.\n26. Only use parts and accessories made for this machine by the manufacturer. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.",
            "27. When starting engine, pull cord slowly until resistance is felt, then pull rapidly. Rapid retraction of starter cord (kickback) will pull hand and arm toward engine faster than you can let go. Broken bones, fractures, bruises or sprains could result.\n28. If situations occur which are not covered in this manual, use care and good judgment. Contact Customer Support for assistance and the name of your nearest servicing dealer.",
            "### Children\n\nTragic accidents can occur if the operator is not alert to the presence of children. Children are often attracted to the mower and the mowing activity. They do not understand the dangers. Never assume that children will remain where you last saw them.\n\n1. Keep children out of the mowing area and under watchful care of a responsible adult other than the operator.\n2. Be alert and turn mower off if a child enters the area.\n3. Before and while moving backwards, look behind and down for small children.\n4. Use extreme care when approaching blind corners, doorways, shrubs, trees, or other objects that may block your vision of a child who may run into the mower.\n5. Keep children away from hot or running engines. They can suffer burns from a hot muffler.\n6. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and be trained and supervised by an adult.\n\n### Service\n\nSafe Handling of Gasoline\n\nTo avoid personal injury or property damage, use extreme care in handling gasoline. Gasoline is extremely flammable and the vapors are explosive. Serious personal injury can occur when gasoline is spilled on yourself or your clothes, which can ignite. Wash your skin and change clothes immediately.\n\n1. Use only an approved gasoline container.\n2. Never fill containers inside a vehicle or on a truck or trailer bed with a plastic liner. Always place containers on the ground away from your vehicle before filling.\n3. Remove gas-powered equipment from the truck or trailer and refuel it on the ground. If this is not possible, then refuel such equipment on a trailer with a portable container, rather than from a gasoline dispenser nozzle.\n4. Keep the nozzle in contact with the rim of the fuel tank or container opening at all times until fueling is complete. Do not use a nozzle lock-open device.\n5. Extinguish all cigarettes, cigars, pipes and other sources of ignition.\n6. Never fuel machine indoors because flammable vapors will accumulate in the area.\n7. Never remove gas cap or add fuel while the engine is hot or running. Allow engine to cool at least two minutes before refueling.\n8. Never overfill fuel tank. Fill tank to no more than \u00bd inch below bottom of filler neck to provide space for fuel expansion.\n9. Replace gasoline cap and tighten securely.\n10. If gasoline is spilled, wipe it off the engine and equipment. Move machine to another area. Wait 5 minutes before starting engine.\n11. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light (e.g. furnace, water heater, space heater, clothes dryer, etc.).\n12. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n13. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light such as a water heater, furnace, clothes dryer etc.\n14. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n\n---\n\n## General Service\n\n1. Never run an engine indoors or in a poorly ventilated area. Engine exhaust contains carbon monoxide, an odorless and deadly gas.\n2. Before cleaning, repairing, or inspecting, make certain the blade and all moving parts have stopped. Disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine to prevent unintended starting.\n3. Check the blade and engine mounting bolts at frequent intervals for proper tightness. Also, visually inspect blade for damage (e.g., bent, cracked, worn). Replace blade with the original equipment manufacturer\u2019s (O.E.M.) blade only, listed in this manual. \u201cUse of parts which do not meet the original equipment specifications may lead to improper performance and compromise safety!\u201d\n4. Mower blades are sharp and can cut. Wrap the blade or wear gloves, and use extra caution when servicing them.\n5. Keep all nuts, bolts, and screws tight to be sure the equipment is in safe working condition.\n6. Never tamper with safety devices. Check their proper operation regularly.\n7. After striking a foreign object, stop the engine, disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine. Thoroughly inspect the mower for any damage. Repair the damage before starting and operating the mower.\n8. Never attempt to make adjustments or repairs to the mower while the engine is running.\n9. Grass catcher components are subject to wear, damage and deterioration, which could expose moving parts or allow objects to be thrown. Frequently check components and replace with the manufacturer\u2019s recommended parts when necessary.\n10. Mower blades are sharp and can cut.

            "### DANGER\n\nThis machine was built to be operated according to the safe operation practices in this manual. As with any type of power equipment, carelessness or error on the part of the operator can result in serious injury. This machine is capable of amputating fingers, hands, toes and feet and throwing objects. Failure to observe the following safety instructions could result in serious injury or death.\n\n### General Operation",
            "1. Read this operator's manual carefully in its entirety before attempting to assemble this machine. Read, understand, and follow all instructions on the machine and in the manual(s) before operation. Keep this manual in a safe place for future and regular reference and for ordering replacement parts.\n2. Be completely familiar with the controls and the proper use of this machine before operating it.\n3. This machine is a precision piece of power equipment, not a plaything. Therefore, exercise extreme caution at all times. This machine has been designed to perform one job: to mow grass. Do not use it for any other purpose.\n4. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and should be trained and supervised by an adult.\n5. Only responsible individuals who are familiar with these rules of safe operation should be allowed to use this machine.\n6. Thoroughly inspect the area where the equipment is to be used. Remove all stones, sticks, wire, bones, toys and other foreign objects, which could be tripped over or picked up and thrown by the blade. Thrown objects can cause serious personal injury.\n7. Plan your mowing pattern to avoid discharge of material toward roads, sidewalks, bystanders and the like. Also, avoid discharging material against a wall or obstruction, which may cause discharged material to ricochet back toward the operator.\n8. To help avoid blade contact or a thrown object injury, stay in operator zone behind handles and keep children, bystanders, helpers and pets at least 75 feet from mower while it is in operation. Stop machine if anyone enters area.\n9. Always wear safety glasses or safety goggles during operation and while performing an adjustment or repair to protect your eyes. Thrown objects which ricochet can cause serious injury to the eyes.\n10. Wear sturdy, rough-soled work shoes and close-fitting slacks and shirts. Shirts and pants that cover the arms and legs and steel-toed shoes are recommended. Never operate this machine in bare feet, sandals, slippery or lightweight (e.g., canvas) shoes.\n11. Do not put hands or feet near rotating parts or under the cutting deck. Contact with blade can amputate fingers, hands, toes and feet.\n12. A missing or damaged discharge cover can cause blade contact or thrown object injuries.\n13. Many injuries occur as a result of the mower being pulled over the foot during a fall caused by slipping or tripping. Do not hold onto the mower if you are falling; release the handle immediately.\n14. Never pull the mower back toward you while you are walking. If you must back the mower away from a wall or obstruction first look down and behind to avoid tripping and then follow these steps:\n    - Step back from mower to fully extend your arms.\n    - Be sure you are well balanced with sure footing.\n    - Pull the mower back slowly, no more than halfway toward you.\n    - Repeat these steps as needed.\n15. Do not operate the mower while under the influence of alcohol or drugs.\n16. Do not engage the self-propelled mechanism on machines so equipped while starting engine.\n17. The blade control is a safety device. Never attempt to bypass its operation. Doing so makes the safety device inoperative and may result in personal injury through contact with the rotating blade. The blade control must operate easily in both directions and automatically return to the disengaged position when released.\n18. Never operate the mower in wet grass. Always be sure of your footing. A slip and fall can cause serious personal injury. If you feel you are losing your footing, release the blade control handle immediately and the blade will stop rotating within three seconds.\n19. Mow only in daylight or good artificial light. Walk, never run.\n20. Stop the blade when crossing gravel drives, walks or roads.\n21. If the equipment should start to vibrate abnormally, stop the engine and check immediately for the cause. Vibration is generally a warning of trouble.\n22. Shut the engine off and wait until the blade comes to a complete stop before removing the grass catcher or unclogging the chute. The cutting blade continues to rotate for a few seconds after the blade control is released. Never place any part of the body in the blade area until you are sure the blade has stopped rotating.\n23. Never operate mower without proper trail shield, discharge cover, grass catcher, blade control or other safety protective devices in place and working. Never operate mower with damaged safety devices. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.\n24. Muffler and engine become hot and can cause a burn. Do not touch.\n25. Never attempt to make a wheel or cutting height adjustment while the engine is running.\n26. Only use parts and accessories made for this machine by the manufacturer. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.",
            "27. When starting engine, pull cord slowly until resistance is felt, then pull rapidly. Rapid retraction of starter cord (kickback) will pull hand and arm toward engine faster than you can let go. Broken bones, fractures, bruises or sprains could result.\n28. If situations occur which are not covered in this manual, use care and good judgment. Contact Customer Support for assistance and the name of your nearest servicing dealer.",
            "### Children\n\nTragic accidents can occur if the operator is not alert to the presence of children. Children are often attracted to the mower and the mowing activity. They do not understand the dangers. Never assume that children will remain where you last saw them.\n\n1. Keep children out of the mowing area and under watchful care of a responsible adult other than the operator.\n2. Be alert and turn mower off if a child enters the area.\n3. Before and while moving backwards, look behind and down for small children.\n4. Use extreme care when approaching blind corners, doorways, shrubs, trees, or other objects that may block your vision of a child who may run into the mower.\n5. Keep children away from hot or running engines. They can suffer burns from a hot muffler.\n6. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and be trained and supervised by an adult.\n\n### Service\n\nSafe Handling of Gasoline\n\nTo avoid personal injury or property damage, use extreme care in handling gasoline. Gasoline is extremely flammable and the vapors are explosive. Serious personal injury can occur when gasoline is spilled on yourself or your clothes, which can ignite. Wash your skin and change clothes immediately.\n\n1. Use only an approved gasoline container.\n2. Never fill containers inside a vehicle or on a truck or trailer bed with a plastic liner. Always place containers on the ground away from your vehicle before filling.\n3. Remove gas-powered equipment from the truck or trailer and refuel it on the ground. If this is not possible, then refuel such equipment on a trailer with a portable container, rather than from a gasoline dispenser nozzle.\n4. Keep the nozzle in contact with the rim of the fuel tank or container opening at all times until fueling is complete. Do not use a nozzle lock-open device.\n5. Extinguish all cigarettes, cigars, pipes and other sources of ignition.\n6. Never fuel machine indoors because flammable vapors will accumulate in the area.\n7. Never remove gas cap or add fuel while the engine is hot or running. Allow engine to cool at least two minutes before refueling.\n8. Never overfill fuel tank. Fill tank to no more than \u00bd inch below bottom of filler neck to provide space for fuel expansion.\n9. Replace gasoline cap and tighten securely.\n10. If gasoline is spilled, wipe it off the engine and equipment. Move machine to another area. Wait 5 minutes before starting engine.\n11. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light (e.g. furnace, water heater, space heater, clothes dryer, etc.).\n12. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n13. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light such as a water heater, furnace, clothes dryer etc.\n14. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n\n---\n\n## General Service\n\n1. Never run an engine indoors or in a poorly ventilated area. Engine exhaust contains carbon monoxide, an odorless and deadly gas.\n2. Before cleaning, repairing, or inspecting, make certain the blade and all moving parts have stopped. Disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine to prevent unintended starting.\n3. Check the blade and engine mounting bolts at frequent intervals for proper tightness. Also, visually inspect blade for damage (e.g., bent, cracked, worn). Replace blade with the original equipment manufacturer\u2019s (O.E.M.) blade only, listed in this manual. \u201cUse of parts which do not meet the original equipment specifications may lead to improper performance and compromise safety!\u201d\n4. Mower blades are sharp and can cut. Wrap the blade or wear gloves, and use extra caution when servicing them.\n5. Keep all nuts, bolts, and screws tight to be sure the equipment is in safe working condition.\n6. Never tamper with safety devices. Check their proper operation regularly.\n7. After striking a foreign object, stop the engine, disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine. Thoroughly inspect the mower for any damage. Repair the damage before starting and operating the mower.\n8. Never attempt to make adjustments or repairs to the mower while the engine is running.\n9. Grass catcher components are subject to wear, damage and deterioration, which could expose moving parts or allow objects to be thrown. Frequently check components and replace with the manufacturer\u2019s recommended parts when necessary.\n10. Mower blades are sharp and can cut.

            "### DANGER\n\nThis machine was built to be operated according to the safe operation practices in this manual. As with any type of power equipment, carelessness or error on the part of the operator can result in serious injury. This machine is capable of amputating fingers, hands, toes and feet and throwing objects. Failure to observe the following safety instructions could result in serious injury or death.\n\n### General Operation",
            "1. Read this operator's manual carefully in its entirety before attempting to assemble this machine. Read, understand, and follow all instructions on the machine and in the manual(s) before operation. Keep this manual in a safe place for future and regular reference and for ordering replacement parts.\n2. Be completely familiar with the controls and the proper use of this machine before operating it.\n3. This machine is a precision piece of power equipment, not a plaything. Therefore, exercise extreme caution at all times. This machine has been designed to perform one job: to mow grass. Do not use it for any other purpose.\n4. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and should be trained and supervised by an adult.\n5. Only responsible individuals who are familiar with these rules of safe operation should be allowed to use this machine.\n6. Thoroughly inspect the area where the equipment is to be used. Remove all stones, sticks, wire, bones, toys and other foreign objects, which could be tripped over or picked up and thrown by the blade. Thrown objects can cause serious personal injury.\n7. Plan your mowing pattern to avoid discharge of material toward roads, sidewalks, bystanders and the like. Also, avoid discharging material against a wall or obstruction, which may cause discharged material to ricochet back toward the operator.\n8. To help avoid blade contact or a thrown object injury, stay in operator zone behind handles and keep children, bystanders, helpers and pets at least 75 feet from mower while it is in operation. Stop machine if anyone enters area.\n9. Always wear safety glasses or safety goggles during operation and while performing an adjustment or repair to protect your eyes. Thrown objects which ricochet can cause serious injury to the eyes.\n10. Wear sturdy, rough-soled work shoes and close-fitting slacks and shirts. Shirts and pants that cover the arms and legs and steel-toed shoes are recommended. Never operate this machine in bare feet, sandals, slippery or lightweight (e.g., canvas) shoes.\n11. Do not put hands or feet near rotating parts or under the cutting deck. Contact with blade can amputate fingers, hands, toes and feet.\n12. A missing or damaged discharge cover can cause blade contact or thrown object injuries.\n13. Many injuries occur as a result of the mower being pulled over the foot during a fall caused by slipping or tripping. Do not hold onto the mower if you are falling; release the handle immediately.\n14. Never pull the mower back toward you while you are walking. If you must back the mower away from a wall or obstruction first look down and behind to avoid tripping and then follow these steps:\n    - Step back from mower to fully extend your arms.\n    - Be sure you are well balanced with sure footing.\n    - Pull the mower back slowly, no more than halfway toward you.\n    - Repeat these steps as needed.\n15. Do not operate the mower while under the influence of alcohol or drugs.\n16. Do not engage the self-propelled mechanism on machines so equipped while starting engine.\n17. The blade control is a safety device. Never attempt to bypass its operation. Doing so makes the safety device inoperative and may result in personal injury through contact with the rotating blade. The blade control must operate easily in both directions and automatically return to the disengaged position when released.\n18. Never operate the mower in wet grass. Always be sure of your footing. A slip and fall can cause serious personal injury. If you feel you are losing your footing, release the blade control handle immediately and the blade will stop rotating within three seconds.\n19. Mow only in daylight or good artificial light. Walk, never run.\n20. Stop the blade when crossing gravel drives, walks or roads.\n21. If the equipment should start to vibrate abnormally, stop the engine and check immediately for the cause. Vibration is generally a warning of trouble.\n22. Shut the engine off and wait until the blade comes to a complete stop before removing the grass catcher or unclogging the chute. The cutting blade continues to rotate for a few seconds after the blade control is released. Never place any part of the body in the blade area until you are sure the blade has stopped rotating.\n23. Never operate mower without proper trail shield, discharge cover, grass catcher, blade control or other safety protective devices in place and working. Never operate mower with damaged safety devices. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.\n24. Muffler and engine become hot and can cause a burn. Do not touch.\n25. Never attempt to make a wheel or cutting height adjustment while the engine is running.\n26. Only use parts and accessories made for this machine by the manufacturer. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.",
            "27. When starting engine, pull cord slowly until resistance is felt, then pull rapidly. Rapid retraction of starter cord (kickback) will pull hand and arm toward engine faster than you can let go. Broken bones, fractures, bruises or sprains could result.\n28. If situations occur which are not covered in this manual, use care and good judgment. Contact Customer Support for assistance and the name of your nearest servicing dealer.",
            "### Children\n\nTragic accidents can occur if the operator is not alert to the presence of children. Children are often attracted to the mower and the mowing activity. They do not understand the dangers. Never assume that children will remain where you last saw them.\n\n1. Keep children out of the mowing area and under watchful care of a responsible adult other than the operator.\n2. Be alert and turn mower off if a child enters the area.\n3. Before and while moving backwards, look behind and down for small children.\n4. Use extreme care when approaching blind corners, doorways, shrubs, trees, or other objects that may block your vision of a child who may run into the mower.\n5. Keep children away from hot or running engines. They can suffer burns from a hot muffler.\n6. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and be trained and supervised by an adult.\n\n### Service\n\nSafe Handling of Gasoline\n\nTo avoid personal injury or property damage, use extreme care in handling gasoline. Gasoline is extremely flammable and the vapors are explosive. Serious personal injury can occur when gasoline is spilled on yourself or your clothes, which can ignite. Wash your skin and change clothes immediately.\n\n1. Use only an approved gasoline container.\n2. Never fill containers inside a vehicle or on a truck or trailer bed with a plastic liner. Always place containers on the ground away from your vehicle before filling.\n3. Remove gas-powered equipment from the truck or trailer and refuel it on the ground. If this is not possible, then refuel such equipment on a trailer with a portable container, rather than from a gasoline dispenser nozzle.\n4. Keep the nozzle in contact with the rim of the fuel tank or container opening at all times until fueling is complete. Do not use a nozzle lock-open device.\n5. Extinguish all cigarettes, cigars, pipes and other sources of ignition.\n6. Never fuel machine indoors because flammable vapors will accumulate in the area.\n7. Never remove gas cap or add fuel while the engine is hot or running. Allow engine to cool at least two minutes before refueling.\n8. Never overfill fuel tank. Fill tank to no more than \u00bd inch below bottom of filler neck to provide space for fuel expansion.\n9. Replace gasoline cap and tighten securely.\n10. If gasoline is spilled, wipe it off the engine and equipment. Move machine to another area. Wait 5 minutes before starting engine.\n11. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light (e.g. furnace, water heater, space heater, clothes dryer, etc.).\n12. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n13. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light such as a water heater, furnace, clothes dryer etc.\n14. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n\n---\n\n## General Service\n\n1. Never run an engine indoors or in a poorly ventilated area. Engine exhaust contains carbon monoxide, an odorless and deadly gas.\n2. Before cleaning, repairing, or inspecting, make certain the blade and all moving parts have stopped. Disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine to prevent unintended starting.\n3. Check the blade and engine mounting bolts at frequent intervals for proper tightness. Also, visually inspect blade for damage (e.g., bent, cracked, worn). Replace blade with the original equipment manufacturer\u2019s (O.E.M.) blade only, listed in this manual. \u201cUse of parts which do not meet the original equipment specifications may lead to improper performance and compromise safety!\u201d\n4. Mower blades are sharp and can cut. Wrap the blade or wear gloves, and use extra caution when servicing them.\n5. Keep all nuts, bolts, and screws tight to be sure the equipment is in safe working condition.\n6. Never tamper with safety devices. Check their proper operation regularly.\n7. After striking a foreign object, stop the engine, disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine. Thoroughly inspect the mower for any damage. Repair the damage before starting and operating the mower.\n8. Never attempt to make adjustments or repairs to the mower while the engine is running.\n9. Grass catcher components are subject to wear, damage and deterioration, which could expose moving parts or allow objects to be thrown. Frequently check components and replace with the manufacturer\u2019s recommended parts when necessary.\n10. Mower blades are sharp and can cut. Wrap the blade or wear gloves, and use extra caution when servicing them.\n11. Do not change the engine governor setting or over-speed the engine.

            "### DANGER\n\nThis machine was built to be operated according to the safe operation practices in this manual. As with any type of power equipment, carelessness or error on the part of the operator can result in serious injury. This machine is capable of amputating fingers, hands, toes and feet and throwing objects. Failure to observe the following safety instructions could result in serious injury or death.\n\n### General Operation",
            "1. Read this operator's manual carefully in its entirety before attempting to assemble this machine. Read, understand, and follow all instructions on the machine and in the manual(s) before operation. Keep this manual in a safe place for future and regular reference and for ordering replacement parts.\n2. Be completely familiar with the controls and the proper use of this machine before operating it.\n3. This machine is a precision piece of power equipment, not a plaything. Therefore, exercise extreme caution at all times. This machine has been designed to perform one job: to mow grass. Do not use it for any other purpose.\n4. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and should be trained and supervised by an adult.\n5. Only responsible individuals who are familiar with these rules of safe operation should be allowed to use this machine.\n6. Thoroughly inspect the area where the equipment is to be used. Remove all stones, sticks, wire, bones, toys and other foreign objects, which could be tripped over or picked up and thrown by the blade. Thrown objects can cause serious personal injury.\n7. Plan your mowing pattern to avoid discharge of material toward roads, sidewalks, bystanders and the like. Also, avoid discharging material against a wall or obstruction, which may cause discharged material to ricochet back toward the operator.\n8. To help avoid blade contact or a thrown object injury, stay in operator zone behind handles and keep children, bystanders, helpers and pets at least 75 feet from mower while it is in operation. Stop machine if anyone enters area.\n9. Always wear safety glasses or safety goggles during operation and while performing an adjustment or repair to protect your eyes. Thrown objects which ricochet can cause serious injury to the eyes.\n10. Wear sturdy, rough-soled work shoes and close-fitting slacks and shirts. Shirts and pants that cover the arms and legs and steel-toed shoes are recommended. Never operate this machine in bare feet, sandals, slippery or lightweight (e.g., canvas) shoes.\n11. Do not put hands or feet near rotating parts or under the cutting deck. Contact with blade can amputate fingers, hands, toes and feet.\n12. A missing or damaged discharge cover can cause blade contact or thrown object injuries.\n13. Many injuries occur as a result of the mower being pulled over the foot during a fall caused by slipping or tripping. Do not hold onto the mower if you are falling; release the handle immediately.\n14. Never pull the mower back toward you while you are walking. If you must back the mower away from a wall or obstruction first look down and behind to avoid tripping and then follow these steps:\n    - Step back from mower to fully extend your arms.\n    - Be sure you are well balanced with sure footing.\n    - Pull the mower back slowly, no more than halfway toward you.\n    - Repeat these steps as needed.\n15. Do not operate the mower while under the influence of alcohol or drugs.\n16. Do not engage the self-propelled mechanism on machines so equipped while starting engine.\n17. The blade control is a safety device. Never attempt to bypass its operation. Doing so makes the safety device inoperative and may result in personal injury through contact with the rotating blade. The blade control must operate easily in both directions and automatically return to the disengaged position when released.\n18. Never operate the mower in wet grass. Always be sure of your footing. A slip and fall can cause serious personal injury. If you feel you are losing your footing, release the blade control handle immediately and the blade will stop rotating within three seconds.\n19. Mow only in daylight or good artificial light. Walk, never run.\n20. Stop the blade when crossing gravel drives, walks or roads.\n21. If the equipment should start to vibrate abnormally, stop the engine and check immediately for the cause. Vibration is generally a warning of trouble.\n22. Shut the engine off and wait until the blade comes to a complete stop before removing the grass catcher or unclogging the chute. The cutting blade continues to rotate for a few seconds after the blade control is released. Never place any part of the body in the blade area until you are sure the blade has stopped rotating.\n23. Never operate mower without proper trail shield, discharge cover, grass catcher, blade control or other safety protective devices in place and working. Never operate mower with damaged safety devices. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.\n24. Muffler and engine become hot and can cause a burn. Do not touch.\n25. Never attempt to make a wheel or cutting height adjustment while the engine is running.\n26. Only use parts and accessories made for this machine by the manufacturer. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.",
            "27. When starting engine, pull cord slowly until resistance is felt, then pull rapidly. Rapid retraction of starter cord (kickback) will pull hand and arm toward engine faster than you can let go. Broken bones, fractures, bruises or sprains could result.\n28. If situations occur which are not covered in this manual, use care and good judgment. Contact Customer Support for assistance and the name of your nearest servicing dealer.",
            "### Children\n\nTragic accidents can occur if the operator is not alert to the presence of children. Children are often attracted to the mower and the mowing activity. They do not understand the dangers. Never assume that children will remain where you last saw them.\n\n1. Keep children out of the mowing area and under watchful care of a responsible adult other than the operator.\n2. Be alert and turn mower off if a child enters the area.\n3. Before and while moving backwards, look behind and down for small children.\n4. Use extreme care when approaching blind corners, doorways, shrubs, trees, or other objects that may block your vision of a child who may run into the mower.\n5. Keep children away from hot or running engines. They can suffer burns from a hot muffler.\n6. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and be trained and supervised by an adult.\n\n### Service\n\nSafe Handling of Gasoline\n\nTo avoid personal injury or property damage, use extreme care in handling gasoline. Gasoline is extremely flammable and the vapors are explosive. Serious personal injury can occur when gasoline is spilled on yourself or your clothes, which can ignite. Wash your skin and change clothes immediately.\n\n1. Use only an approved gasoline container.\n2. Never fill containers inside a vehicle or on a truck or trailer bed with a plastic liner. Always place containers on the ground away from your vehicle before filling.\n3. Remove gas-powered equipment from the truck or trailer and refuel it on the ground. If this is not possible, then refuel such equipment on a trailer with a portable container, rather than from a gasoline dispenser nozzle.\n4. Keep the nozzle in contact with the rim of the fuel tank or container opening at all times until fueling is complete. Do not use a nozzle lock-open device.\n5. Extinguish all cigarettes, cigars, pipes and other sources of ignition.\n6. Never fuel machine indoors because flammable vapors will accumulate in the area.\n7. Never remove gas cap or add fuel while the engine is hot or running. Allow engine to cool at least two minutes before refueling.\n8. Never overfill fuel tank. Fill tank to no more than \u00bd inch below bottom of filler neck to provide space for fuel expansion.\n9. Replace gasoline cap and tighten securely.\n10. If gasoline is spilled, wipe it off the engine and equipment. Move machine to another area. Wait 5 minutes before starting engine.\n11. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light (e.g. furnace, water heater, space heater, clothes dryer, etc.).\n12. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n13. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light such as a water heater, furnace, clothes dryer etc.\n14. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n\n---\n\n## General Service\n\n1. Never run an engine indoors or in a poorly ventilated area. Engine exhaust contains carbon monoxide, an odorless and deadly gas.\n2. Before cleaning, repairing, or inspecting, make certain the blade and all moving parts have stopped. Disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine to prevent unintended starting.\n3. Check the blade and engine mounting bolts at frequent intervals for proper tightness. Also, visually inspect blade for damage (e.g., bent, cracked, worn). Replace blade with the original equipment manufacturer\u2019s (O.E.M.) blade only, listed in this manual. \u201cUse of parts which do not meet the original equipment specifications may lead to improper performance and compromise safety!\u201d\n4. Mower blades are sharp and can cut. Wrap the blade or wear gloves, and use extra caution when servicing them.\n5. Keep all nuts, bolts, and screws tight to be sure the equipment is in safe working condition.\n6. Never tamper with safety devices. Check their proper operation regularly.\n7. After striking a foreign object, stop the engine, disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine. Thoroughly inspect the mower for any damage. Repair the damage before starting and operating the mower.\n8. Never attempt to make adjustments or repairs to the mower while the engine is running.\n9. Grass catcher components are subject to wear, damage and deterioration, which could expose moving parts or allow objects to be thrown. Frequently check components and replace with the manufacturer\u2019s recommended parts when necessary.\n10. Mower blades are sharp and can cut.

            "### DANGER\n\nThis machine was built to be operated according to the safe operation practices in this manual. As with any type of power equipment, carelessness or error on the part of the operator can result in serious injury. This machine is capable of amputating fingers, hands, toes and feet and throwing objects. Failure to observe the following safety instructions could result in serious injury or death.\n\n### General Operation",
            "1. Read this operator's manual carefully in its entirety before attempting to assemble this machine. Read, understand, and follow all instructions on the machine and in the manual(s) before operation. Keep this manual in a safe place for future and regular reference and for ordering replacement parts.\n2. Be completely familiar with the controls and the proper use of this machine before operating it.\n3. This machine is a precision piece of power equipment, not a plaything. Therefore, exercise extreme caution at all times. This machine has been designed to perform one job: to mow grass. Do not use it for any other purpose.\n4. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and should be trained and supervised by an adult.\n5. Only responsible individuals who are familiar with these rules of safe operation should be allowed to use this machine.\n6. Thoroughly inspect the area where the equipment is to be used. Remove all stones, sticks, wire, bones, toys and other foreign objects, which could be tripped over or picked up and thrown by the blade. Thrown objects can cause serious personal injury.\n7. Plan your mowing pattern to avoid discharge of material toward roads, sidewalks, bystanders and the like. Also, avoid discharging material against a wall or obstruction, which may cause discharged material to ricochet back toward the operator.\n8. To help avoid blade contact or a thrown object injury, stay in operator zone behind handles and keep children, bystanders, helpers and pets at least 75 feet from mower while it is in operation. Stop machine if anyone enters area.\n9. Always wear safety glasses or safety goggles during operation and while performing an adjustment or repair to protect your eyes. Thrown objects which ricochet can cause serious injury to the eyes.\n10. Wear sturdy, rough-soled work shoes and close-fitting slacks and shirts. Shirts and pants that cover the arms and legs and steel-toed shoes are recommended. Never operate this machine in bare feet, sandals, slippery or lightweight (e.g., canvas) shoes.\n11. Do not put hands or feet near rotating parts or under the cutting deck. Contact with blade can amputate fingers, hands, toes and feet.\n12. A missing or damaged discharge cover can cause blade contact or thrown object injuries.\n13. Many injuries occur as a result of the mower being pulled over the foot during a fall caused by slipping or tripping. Do not hold onto the mower if you are falling; release the handle immediately.\n14. Never pull the mower back toward you while you are walking. If you must back the mower away from a wall or obstruction first look down and behind to avoid tripping and then follow these steps:\n    - Step back from mower to fully extend your arms.\n    - Be sure you are well balanced with sure footing.\n    - Pull the mower back slowly, no more than halfway toward you.\n    - Repeat these steps as needed.\n15. Do not operate the mower while under the influence of alcohol or drugs.\n16. Do not engage the self-propelled mechanism on machines so equipped while starting engine.\n17. The blade control is a safety device. Never attempt to bypass its operation. Doing so makes the safety device inoperative and may result in personal injury through contact with the rotating blade. The blade control must operate easily in both directions and automatically return to the disengaged position when released.\n18. Never operate the mower in wet grass. Always be sure of your footing. A slip and fall can cause serious personal injury. If you feel you are losing your footing, release the blade control handle immediately and the blade will stop rotating within three seconds.\n19. Mow only in daylight or good artificial light. Walk, never run.\n20. Stop the blade when crossing gravel drives, walks or roads.\n21. If the equipment should start to vibrate abnormally, stop the engine and check immediately for the cause. Vibration is generally a warning of trouble.\n22. Shut the engine off and wait until the blade comes to a complete stop before removing the grass catcher or unclogging the chute. The cutting blade continues to rotate for a few seconds after the blade control is released. Never place any part of the body in the blade area until you are sure the blade has stopped rotating.\n23. Never operate mower without proper trail shield, discharge cover, grass catcher, blade control or other safety protective devices in place and working. Never operate mower with damaged safety devices. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.\n24. Muffler and engine become hot and can cause a burn. Do not touch.\n25. Never attempt to make a wheel or cutting height adjustment while the engine is running.\n26. Only use parts and accessories made for this machine by the manufacturer. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.",
            "27. When starting engine, pull cord slowly until resistance is felt, then pull rapidly. Rapid retraction of starter cord (kickback) will pull hand and arm toward engine faster than you can let go. Broken bones, fractures, bruises or sprains could result.\n28. If situations occur which are not covered in this manual, use care and good judgment. Contact Customer Support for assistance and the name of your nearest servicing dealer.",
            "### Children\n\nTragic accidents can occur if the operator is not alert to the presence of children. Children are often attracted to the mower and the mowing activity. They do not understand the dangers. Never assume that children will remain where you last saw them.\n\n1. Keep children out of the mowing area and under watchful care of a responsible adult other than the operator.\n2. Be alert and turn mower off if a child enters the area.\n3. Before and while moving backwards, look behind and down for small children.\n4. Use extreme care when approaching blind corners, doorways, shrubs, trees, or other objects that may block your vision of a child who may run into the mower.\n5. Keep children away from hot or running engines. They can suffer burns from a hot muffler.\n6. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and be trained and supervised by an adult.\n\n### Service\n\nSafe Handling of Gasoline\n\nTo avoid personal injury or property damage, use extreme care in handling gasoline. Gasoline is extremely flammable and the vapors are explosive. Serious personal injury can occur when gasoline is spilled on yourself or your clothes, which can ignite. Wash your skin and change clothes immediately.\n\n1. Use only an approved gasoline container.\n2. Never fill containers inside a vehicle or on a truck or trailer bed with a plastic liner. Always place containers on the ground away from your vehicle before filling.\n3. Remove gas-powered equipment from the truck or trailer and refuel it on the ground. If this is not possible, then refuel such equipment on a trailer with a portable container, rather than from a gasoline dispenser nozzle.\n4. Keep the nozzle in contact with the rim of the fuel tank or container opening at all times until fueling is complete. Do not use a nozzle lock-open device.\n5. Extinguish all cigarettes, cigars, pipes and other sources of ignition.\n6. Never fuel machine indoors because flammable vapors will accumulate in the area.\n7. Never remove gas cap or add fuel while the engine is hot or running. Allow engine to cool at least two minutes before refueling.\n8. Never overfill fuel tank. Fill tank to no more than \u00bd inch below bottom of filler neck to provide space for fuel expansion.\n9. Replace gasoline cap and tighten securely.\n10. If gasoline is spilled, wipe it off the engine and equipment. Move machine to another area. Wait 5 minutes before starting engine.\n11. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light (e.g. furnace, water heater, space heater, clothes dryer, etc.).\n12. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n13. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light such as a water heater, furnace, clothes dryer etc.\n14. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n\n---\n\n## General Service\n\n1. Never run an engine indoors or in a poorly ventilated area. Engine exhaust contains carbon monoxide, an odorless and deadly gas.\n2. Before cleaning, repairing, or inspecting, make certain the blade and all moving parts have stopped. Disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine to prevent unintended starting.\n3. Check the blade and engine mounting bolts at frequent intervals for proper tightness. Also, visually inspect blade for damage (e.g., bent, cracked, worn). Replace blade with the original equipment manufacturer\u2019s (O.E.M.) blade only, listed in this manual. \u201cUse of parts which do not meet the original equipment specifications may lead to improper performance and compromise safety!\u201d\n4. Mower blades are sharp and can cut. Wrap the blade or wear gloves, and use extra caution when servicing them.\n5. Keep all nuts, bolts, and screws tight to be sure the equipment is in safe working condition.\n6. Never tamper with safety devices. Check their proper operation regularly.\n7. After striking a foreign object, stop the engine, disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine. Thoroughly inspect the mower for any damage. Repair the damage before starting and operating the mower.\n8. Never attempt to make adjustments or repairs to the mower while the engine is running.\n9. Grass catcher components are subject to wear, damage and deterioration, which could expose moving parts or allow objects to be thrown. Frequently check components and replace with the manufacturer\u2019s recommended parts when necessary.\n10. Mower blades are sharp and can cut.

            "### DANGER\n\nThis machine was built to be operated according to the safe operation practices in this manual. As with any type of power equipment, carelessness or error on the part of the operator can result in serious injury. This machine is capable of amputating fingers, hands, toes and feet and throwing objects. Failure to observe the following safety instructions could result in serious injury or death.\n\n### General Operation",
            "1. Read this operator's manual carefully in its entirety before attempting to assemble this machine. Read, understand, and follow all instructions on the machine and in the manual(s) before operation. Keep this manual in a safe place for future and regular reference and for ordering replacement parts.\n2. Be completely familiar with the controls and the proper use of this machine before operating it.\n3. This machine is a precision piece of power equipment, not a plaything. Therefore, exercise extreme caution at all times. This machine has been designed to perform one job: to mow grass. Do not use it for any other purpose.\n4. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and should be trained and supervised by an adult.\n5. Only responsible individuals who are familiar with these rules of safe operation should be allowed to use this machine.\n6. Thoroughly inspect the area where the equipment is to be used. Remove all stones, sticks, wire, bones, toys and other foreign objects, which could be tripped over or picked up and thrown by the blade. Thrown objects can cause serious personal injury.\n7. Plan your mowing pattern to avoid discharge of material toward roads, sidewalks, bystanders and the like. Also, avoid discharging material against a wall or obstruction, which may cause discharged material to ricochet back toward the operator.\n8. To help avoid blade contact or a thrown object injury, stay in operator zone behind handles and keep children, bystanders, helpers and pets at least 75 feet from mower while it is in operation. Stop machine if anyone enters area.\n9. Always wear safety glasses or safety goggles during operation and while performing an adjustment or repair to protect your eyes. Thrown objects which ricochet can cause serious injury to the eyes.\n10. Wear sturdy, rough-soled work shoes and close-fitting slacks and shirts. Shirts and pants that cover the arms and legs and steel-toed shoes are recommended. Never operate this machine in bare feet, sandals, slippery or lightweight (e.g., canvas) shoes.\n11. Do not put hands or feet near rotating parts or under the cutting deck. Contact with blade can amputate fingers, hands, toes and feet.\n12. A missing or damaged discharge cover can cause blade contact or thrown object injuries.\n13. Many injuries occur as a result of the mower being pulled over the foot during a fall caused by slipping or tripping. Do not hold onto the mower if you are falling; release the handle immediately.\n14. Never pull the mower back toward you while you are walking. If you must back the mower away from a wall or obstruction first look down and behind to avoid tripping and then follow these steps:\n    - Step back from mower to fully extend your arms.\n    - Be sure you are well balanced with sure footing.\n    - Pull the mower back slowly, no more than halfway toward you.\n    - Repeat these steps as needed.\n15. Do not operate the mower while under the influence of alcohol or drugs.\n16. Do not engage the self-propelled mechanism on machines so equipped while starting engine.\n17. The blade control is a safety device. Never attempt to bypass its operation. Doing so makes the safety device inoperative and may result in personal injury through contact with the rotating blade. The blade control must operate easily in both directions and automatically return to the disengaged position when released.\n18. Never operate the mower in wet grass. Always be sure of your footing. A slip and fall can cause serious personal injury. If you feel you are losing your footing, release the blade control handle immediately and the blade will stop rotating within three seconds.\n19. Mow only in daylight or good artificial light. Walk, never run.\n20. Stop the blade when crossing gravel drives, walks or roads.\n21. If the equipment should start to vibrate abnormally, stop the engine and check immediately for the cause. Vibration is generally a warning of trouble.\n22. Shut the engine off and wait until the blade comes to a complete stop before removing the grass catcher or unclogging the chute. The cutting blade continues to rotate for a few seconds after the blade control is released. Never place any part of the body in the blade area until you are sure the blade has stopped rotating.\n23. Never operate mower without proper trail shield, discharge cover, grass catcher, blade control or other safety protective devices in place and working. Never operate mower with damaged safety devices. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.\n24. Muffler and engine become hot and can cause a burn. Do not touch.\n25. Never attempt to make a wheel or cutting height adjustment while the engine is running.\n26. Only use parts and accessories made for this machine by the manufacturer. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.",
            "27. When starting engine, pull cord slowly until resistance is felt, then pull rapidly. Rapid retraction of starter cord (kickback) will pull hand and arm toward engine faster than you can let go. Broken bones, fractures, bruises or sprains could result.\n28. If situations occur which are not covered in this manual, use care and good judgment. Contact Customer Support for assistance and the name of your nearest servicing dealer.",
            "### Children\n\nTragic accidents can occur if the operator is not alert to the presence of children. Children are often attracted to the mower and the mowing activity. They do not understand the dangers. Never assume that children will remain where you last saw them.\n\n1. Keep children out of the mowing area and under watchful care of a responsible adult other than the operator.\n2. Be alert and turn mower off if a child enters the area.\n3. Before and while moving backwards, look behind and down for small children.\n4. Use extreme care when approaching blind corners, doorways, shrubs, trees, or other objects that may block your vision of a child who may run into the mower.\n5. Keep children away from hot or running engines. They can suffer burns from a hot muffler.\n6. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and be trained and supervised by an adult.\n\n### Service\n\nSafe Handling of Gasoline\n\nTo avoid personal injury or property damage, use extreme care in handling gasoline. Gasoline is extremely flammable and the vapors are explosive. Serious personal injury can occur when gasoline is spilled on yourself or your clothes, which can ignite. Wash your skin and change clothes immediately.\n\n1. Use only an approved gasoline container.\n2. Never fill containers inside a vehicle or on a truck or trailer bed with a plastic liner. Always place containers on the ground away from your vehicle before filling.\n3. Remove gas-powered equipment from the truck or trailer and refuel it on the ground. If this is not possible, then refuel such equipment on a trailer with a portable container, rather than from a gasoline dispenser nozzle.\n4. Keep the nozzle in contact with the rim of the fuel tank or container opening at all times until fueling is complete. Do not use a nozzle lock-open device.\n5. Extinguish all cigarettes, cigars, pipes and other sources of ignition.\n6. Never fuel machine indoors because flammable vapors will accumulate in the area.\n7. Never remove gas cap or add fuel while the engine is hot or running. Allow engine to cool at least two minutes before refueling.\n8. Never overfill fuel tank. Fill tank to no more than \u00bd inch below bottom of filler neck to provide space for fuel expansion.\n9. Replace gasoline cap and tighten securely.\n10. If gasoline is spilled, wipe it off the engine and equipment. Move machine to another area. Wait 5 minutes before starting engine.\n11. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light (e.g. furnace, water heater, space heater, clothes dryer, etc.).\n12. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n13. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light such as a water heater, furnace, clothes dryer etc.\n14. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n\n---\n\n## General Service\n\n1. Never run an engine indoors or in a poorly ventilated area. Engine exhaust contains carbon monoxide, an odorless and deadly gas.\n2. Before cleaning, repairing, or inspecting, make certain the blade and all moving parts have stopped. Disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine to prevent unintended starting.\n3. Check the blade and engine mounting bolts at frequent intervals for proper tightness. Also, visually inspect blade for damage (e.g., bent, cracked, worn). Replace blade with the original equipment manufacturer\u2019s (O.E.M.) blade only, listed in this manual. \u201cUse of parts which do not meet the original equipment specifications may lead to improper performance and compromise safety!\u201d\n4. Mower blades are sharp and can cut. Wrap the blade or wear gloves, and use extra caution when servicing them.\n5. Keep all nuts, bolts, and screws tight to be sure the equipment is in safe working condition.\n6. Never tamper with safety devices. Check their proper operation regularly.\n7. After striking a foreign object, stop the engine, disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine. Thoroughly inspect the mower for any damage. Repair the damage before starting and operating the mower.\n8. Never attempt to make adjustments or repairs to the mower while the engine is running.\n9. Grass catcher components are subject to wear, damage and deterioration, which could expose moving parts or allow objects to be thrown. Frequently check components and replace with the manufacturer\u2019s recommended parts when necessary.\n10. Mower blades are sharp and can cut.

            "### DANGER\n\nThis machine was built to be operated according to the safe operation practices in this manual. As with any type of power equipment, carelessness or error on the part of the operator can result in serious injury. This machine is capable of amputating fingers, hands, toes and feet and throwing objects. Failure to observe the following safety instructions could result in serious injury or death.\n\n### General Operation",
            "1. Read this operator's manual carefully in its entirety before attempting to assemble this machine. Read, understand, and follow all instructions on the machine and in the manual(s) before operation. Keep this manual in a safe place for future and regular reference and for ordering replacement parts.\n2. Be completely familiar with the controls and the proper use of this machine before operating it.\n3. This machine is a precision piece of power equipment, not a plaything. Therefore, exercise extreme caution at all times. This machine has been designed to perform one job: to mow grass. Do not use it for any other purpose.\n4. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and should be trained and supervised by an adult.\n5. Only responsible individuals who are familiar with these rules of safe operation should be allowed to use this machine.\n6. Thoroughly inspect the area where the equipment is to be used. Remove all stones, sticks, wire, bones, toys and other foreign objects, which could be tripped over or picked up and thrown by the blade. Thrown objects can cause serious personal injury.\n7. Plan your mowing pattern to avoid discharge of material toward roads, sidewalks, bystanders and the like. Also, avoid discharging material against a wall or obstruction, which may cause discharged material to ricochet back toward the operator.\n8. To help avoid blade contact or a thrown object injury, stay in operator zone behind handles and keep children, bystanders, helpers and pets at least 75 feet from mower while it is in operation. Stop machine if anyone enters area.\n9. Always wear safety glasses or safety goggles during operation and while performing an adjustment or repair to protect your eyes. Thrown objects which ricochet can cause serious injury to the eyes.\n10. Wear sturdy, rough-soled work shoes and close-fitting slacks and shirts. Shirts and pants that cover the arms and legs and steel-toed shoes are recommended. Never operate this machine in bare feet, sandals, slippery or lightweight (e.g., canvas) shoes.\n11. Do not put hands or feet near rotating parts or under the cutting deck. Contact with blade can amputate fingers, hands, toes and feet.\n12. A missing or damaged discharge cover can cause blade contact or thrown object injuries.\n13. Many injuries occur as a result of the mower being pulled over the foot during a fall caused by slipping or tripping. Do not hold onto the mower if you are falling; release the handle immediately.\n14. Never pull the mower back toward you while you are walking. If you must back the mower away from a wall or obstruction first look down and behind to avoid tripping and then follow these steps:\n    - Step back from mower to fully extend your arms.\n    - Be sure you are well balanced with sure footing.\n    - Pull the mower back slowly, no more than halfway toward you.\n    - Repeat these steps as needed.\n15. Do not operate the mower while under the influence of alcohol or drugs.\n16. Do not engage the self-propelled mechanism on machines so equipped while starting engine.\n17. The blade control is a safety device. Never attempt to bypass its operation. Doing so makes the safety device inoperative and may result in personal injury through contact with the rotating blade. The blade control must operate easily in both directions and automatically return to the disengaged position when released.\n18. Never operate the mower in wet grass. Always be sure of your footing. A slip and fall can cause serious personal injury. If you feel you are losing your footing, release the blade control handle immediately and the blade will stop rotating within three seconds.\n19. Mow only in daylight or good artificial light. Walk, never run.\n20. Stop the blade when crossing gravel drives, walks or roads.\n21. If the equipment should start to vibrate abnormally, stop the engine and check immediately for the cause. Vibration is generally a warning of trouble.\n22. Shut the engine off and wait until the blade comes to a complete stop before removing the grass catcher or unclogging the chute. The cutting blade continues to rotate for a few seconds after the blade control is released. Never place any part of the body in the blade area until you are sure the blade has stopped rotating.\n23. Never operate mower without proper trail shield, discharge cover, grass catcher, blade control or other safety protective devices in place and working. Never operate mower with damaged safety devices. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.\n24. Muffler and engine become hot and can cause a burn. Do not touch.\n25. Never attempt to make a wheel or cutting height adjustment while the engine is running.\n26. Only use parts and accessories made for this machine by the manufacturer. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.",
            "27. When starting engine, pull cord slowly until resistance is felt, then pull rapidly. Rapid retraction of starter cord (kickback) will pull hand and arm toward engine faster than you can let go. Broken bones, fractures, bruises or sprains could result.\n28. If situations occur which are not covered in this manual, use care and good judgment. Contact Customer Support for assistance and the name of your nearest servicing dealer.",
            "### Children\n\nTragic accidents can occur if the operator is not alert to the presence of children. Children are often attracted to the mower and the mowing activity. They do not understand the dangers. Never assume that children will remain where you last saw them.\n\n1. Keep children out of the mowing area and under watchful care of a responsible adult other than the operator.\n2. Be alert and turn mower off if a child enters the area.\n3. Before and while moving backwards, look behind and down for small children.\n4. Use extreme care when approaching blind corners, doorways, shrubs, trees, or other objects that may block your vision of a child who may run into the mower.\n5. Keep children away from hot or running engines. They can suffer burns from a hot muffler.\n6. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and be trained and supervised by an adult.\n\n### Service\n\nSafe Handling of Gasoline\n\nTo avoid personal injury or property damage, use extreme care in handling gasoline. Gasoline is extremely flammable and the vapors are explosive. Serious personal injury can occur when gasoline is spilled on yourself or your clothes, which can ignite. Wash your skin and change clothes immediately.\n\n1. Use only an approved gasoline container.\n2. Never fill containers inside a vehicle or on a truck or trailer bed with a plastic liner. Always place containers on the ground away from your vehicle before filling.\n3. Remove gas-powered equipment from the truck or trailer and refuel it on the ground. If this is not possible, then refuel such equipment on a trailer with a portable container, rather than from a gasoline dispenser nozzle.\n4. Keep the nozzle in contact with the rim of the fuel tank or container opening at all times until fueling is complete. Do not use a nozzle lock-open device.\n5. Extinguish all cigarettes, cigars, pipes and other sources of ignition.\n6. Never fuel machine indoors because flammable vapors will accumulate in the area.\n7. Never remove gas cap or add fuel while the engine is hot or running. Allow engine to cool at least two minutes before refueling.\n8. Never overfill fuel tank. Fill tank to no more than \u00bd inch below bottom of filler neck to provide space for fuel expansion.\n9. Replace gasoline cap and tighten securely.\n10. If gasoline is spilled, wipe it off the engine and equipment. Move machine to another area. Wait 5 minutes before starting engine.\n11. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light (e.g. furnace, water heater, space heater, clothes dryer, etc.).\n12. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n13. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light such as a water heater, furnace, clothes dryer etc.\n14. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n\n---\n\n## General Service\n\n1. Never run an engine indoors or in a poorly ventilated area. Engine exhaust contains carbon monoxide, an odorless and deadly gas.\n2. Before cleaning, repairing, or inspecting, make certain the blade and all moving parts have stopped. Disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine to prevent unintended starting.\n3. Check the blade and engine mounting bolts at frequent intervals for proper tightness. Also, visually inspect blade for damage (e.g., bent, cracked, worn). Replace blade with the original equipment manufacturer\u2019s (O.E.M.) blade only, listed in this manual. \u201cUse of parts which do not meet the original equipment specifications may lead to improper performance and compromise safety!\u201d\n4. Mower blades are sharp and can cut. Wrap the blade or wear gloves, and use extra caution when servicing them.\n5. Keep all nuts, bolts, and screws tight to be sure the equipment is in safe working condition.\n6. Never tamper with safety devices. Check their proper operation regularly.\n7. After striking a foreign object, stop the engine, disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine. Thoroughly inspect the mower for any damage. Repair the damage before starting and operating the mower.\n8. Never attempt to make adjustments or repairs to the mower while the engine is running.\n9. Grass catcher components are subject to wear, damage and deterioration, which could expose moving parts or allow objects to be thrown. Frequently check components and replace with the manufacturer\u2019s recommended parts when necessary.\n10. Mower blades are sharp and can cut.

            "### DANGER\n\nThis machine was built to be operated according to the safe operation practices in this manual. As with any type of power equipment, carelessness or error on the part of the operator can result in serious injury. This machine is capable of amputating fingers, hands, toes and feet and throwing objects. Failure to observe the following safety instructions could result in serious injury or death.\n\n### General Operation",
            "1. Read this operator's manual carefully in its entirety before attempting to assemble this machine. Read, understand, and follow all instructions on the machine and in the manual(s) before operation. Keep this manual in a safe place for future and regular reference and for ordering replacement parts.\n2. Be completely familiar with the controls and the proper use of this machine before operating it.\n3. This machine is a precision piece of power equipment, not a plaything. Therefore, exercise extreme caution at all times. This machine has been designed to perform one job: to mow grass. Do not use it for any other purpose.\n4. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and should be trained and supervised by an adult.\n5. Only responsible individuals who are familiar with these rules of safe operation should be allowed to use this machine.\n6. Thoroughly inspect the area where the equipment is to be used. Remove all stones, sticks, wire, bones, toys and other foreign objects, which could be tripped over or picked up and thrown by the blade. Thrown objects can cause serious personal injury.\n7. Plan your mowing pattern to avoid discharge of material toward roads, sidewalks, bystanders and the like. Also, avoid discharging material against a wall or obstruction, which may cause discharged material to ricochet back toward the operator.\n8. To help avoid blade contact or a thrown object injury, stay in operator zone behind handles and keep children, bystanders, helpers and pets at least 75 feet from mower while it is in operation. Stop machine if anyone enters area.\n9. Always wear safety glasses or safety goggles during operation and while performing an adjustment or repair to protect your eyes. Thrown objects which ricochet can cause serious injury to the eyes.\n10. Wear sturdy, rough-soled work shoes and close-fitting slacks and shirts. Shirts and pants that cover the arms and legs and steel-toed shoes are recommended. Never operate this machine in bare feet, sandals, slippery or lightweight (e.g., canvas) shoes.\n11. Do not put hands or feet near rotating parts or under the cutting deck. Contact with blade can amputate fingers, hands, toes and feet.\n12. A missing or damaged discharge cover can cause blade contact or thrown object injuries.\n13. Many injuries occur as a result of the mower being pulled over the foot during a fall caused by slipping or tripping. Do not hold onto the mower if you are falling; release the handle immediately.\n14. Never pull the mower back toward you while you are walking. If you must back the mower away from a wall or obstruction first look down and behind to avoid tripping and then follow these steps:\n    - Step back from mower to fully extend your arms.\n    - Be sure you are well balanced with sure footing.\n    - Pull the mower back slowly, no more than halfway toward you.\n    - Repeat these steps as needed.\n15. Do not operate the mower while under the influence of alcohol or drugs.\n16. Do not engage the self-propelled mechanism on machines so equipped while starting engine.\n17. The blade control is a safety device. Never attempt to bypass its operation. Doing so makes the safety device inoperative and may result in personal injury through contact with the rotating blade. The blade control must operate easily in both directions and automatically return to the disengaged position when released.\n18. Never operate the mower in wet grass. Always be sure of your footing. A slip and fall can cause serious personal injury. If you feel you are losing your footing, release the blade control handle immediately and the blade will stop rotating within three seconds.\n19. Mow only in daylight or good artificial light. Walk, never run.\n20. Stop the blade when crossing gravel drives, walks or roads.\n21. If the equipment should start to vibrate abnormally, stop the engine and check immediately for the cause. Vibration is generally a warning of trouble.\n22. Shut the engine off and wait until the blade comes to a complete stop before removing the grass catcher or unclogging the chute. The cutting blade continues to rotate for a few seconds after the blade control is released. Never place any part of the body in the blade area until you are sure the blade has stopped rotating.\n23. Never operate mower without proper trail shield, discharge cover, grass catcher, blade control or other safety protective devices in place and working. Never operate mower with damaged safety devices. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.\n24. Muffler and engine become hot and can cause a burn. Do not touch.\n25. Never attempt to make a wheel or cutting height adjustment while the engine is running.\n26. Only use parts and accessories made for this machine by the manufacturer. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.",
            "27. When starting engine, pull cord slowly until resistance is felt, then pull rapidly. Rapid retraction of starter cord (kickback) will pull hand and arm toward engine faster than you can let go. Broken bones, fractures, bruises or sprains could result.\n28. If situations occur which are not covered in this manual, use care and good judgment. Contact Customer Support for assistance and the name of your nearest servicing dealer.",
            "### Children\n\nTragic accidents can occur if the operator is not alert to the presence of children. Children are often attracted to the mower and the mowing activity. They do not understand the dangers. Never assume that children will remain where you last saw them.\n\n1. Keep children out of the mowing area and under watchful care of a responsible adult other than the operator.\n2. Be alert and turn mower off if a child enters the area.\n3. Before and while moving backwards, look behind and down for small children.\n4. Use extreme care when approaching blind corners, doorways, shrubs, trees, or other objects that may block your vision of a child who may run into the mower.\n5. Keep children away from hot or running engines. They can suffer burns from a hot muffler.\n6. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and be trained and supervised by an adult.\n\n### Service\n\nSafe Handling of Gasoline\n\nTo avoid personal injury or property damage, use extreme care in handling gasoline. Gasoline is extremely flammable and the vapors are explosive. Serious personal injury can occur when gasoline is spilled on yourself or your clothes, which can ignite. Wash your skin and change clothes immediately.\n\n1. Use only an approved gasoline container.\n2. Never fill containers inside a vehicle or on a truck or trailer bed with a plastic liner. Always place containers on the ground away from your vehicle before filling.\n3. Remove gas-powered equipment from the truck or trailer and refuel it on the ground. If this is not possible, then refuel such equipment on a trailer with a portable container, rather than from a gasoline dispenser nozzle.\n4. Keep the nozzle in contact with the rim of the fuel tank or container opening at all times until fueling is complete. Do not use a nozzle lock-open device.\n5. Extinguish all cigarettes, cigars, pipes and other sources of ignition.\n6. Never fuel machine indoors because flammable vapors will accumulate in the area.\n7. Never remove gas cap or add fuel while the engine is hot or running. Allow engine to cool at least two minutes before refueling.\n8. Never overfill fuel tank. Fill tank to no more than \u00bd inch below bottom of filler neck to provide space for fuel expansion.\n9. Replace gasoline cap and tighten securely.\n10. If gasoline is spilled, wipe it off the engine and equipment. Move machine to another area. Wait 5 minutes before starting engine.\n11. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light (e.g. furnace, water heater, space heater, clothes dryer, etc.).\n12. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n13. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light such as a water heater, furnace, clothes dryer etc.\n14. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n\n---\n\n## General Service\n\n1. Never run an engine indoors or in a poorly ventilated area. Engine exhaust contains carbon monoxide, an odorless and deadly gas.\n2. Before cleaning, repairing, or inspecting, make certain the blade and all moving parts have stopped. Disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine to prevent unintended starting.\n3. Check the blade and engine mounting bolts at frequent intervals for proper tightness. Also, visually inspect blade for damage (e.g., bent, cracked, worn). Replace blade with the original equipment manufacturer\u2019s (O.E.M.) blade only, listed in this manual. \u201cUse of parts which do not meet the original equipment specifications may lead to improper performance and compromise safety!\u201d\n4. Mower blades are sharp and can cut. Wrap the blade or wear gloves, and use extra caution when servicing them.\n5. Keep all nuts, bolts, and screws tight to be sure the equipment is in safe working condition.\n6. Never tamper with safety devices. Check their proper operation regularly.\n7. After striking a foreign object, stop the engine, disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine. Thoroughly inspect the mower for any damage. Repair the damage before starting and operating the mower.\n8. Never attempt to make adjustments or repairs to the mower while the engine is running.\n9. Grass catcher components are subject to wear, damage and deterioration, which could expose moving parts or allow objects to be thrown. Frequently check components and replace with the manufacturer\u2019s recommended parts when necessary.\n10. Mower blades are sharp and can cut.

            "### DANGER\n\nThis machine was built to be operated according to the safe operation practices in this manual. As with any type of power equipment, carelessness or error on the part of the operator can result in serious injury. This machine is capable of amputating fingers, hands, toes and feet and throwing objects. Failure to observe the following safety instructions could result in serious injury or death.\n\n### General Operation",
            "1. Read this operator's manual carefully in its entirety before attempting to assemble this machine. Read, understand, and follow all instructions on the machine and in the manual(s) before operation. Keep this manual in a safe place for future and regular reference and for ordering replacement parts.\n2. Be completely familiar with the controls and the proper use of this machine before operating it.\n3. This machine is a precision piece of power equipment, not a plaything. Therefore, exercise extreme caution at all times. This machine has been designed to perform one job: to mow grass. Do not use it for any other purpose.\n4. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and should be trained and supervised by an adult.\n5. Only responsible individuals who are familiar with these rules of safe operation should be allowed to use this machine.\n6. Thoroughly inspect the area where the equipment is to be used. Remove all stones, sticks, wire, bones, toys and other foreign objects, which could be tripped over or picked up and thrown by the blade. Thrown objects can cause serious personal injury.\n7. Plan your mowing pattern to avoid discharge of material toward roads, sidewalks, bystanders and the like. Also, avoid discharging material against a wall or obstruction, which may cause discharged material to ricochet back toward the operator.\n8. To help avoid blade contact or a thrown object injury, stay in operator zone behind handles and keep children, bystanders, helpers and pets at least 75 feet from mower while it is in operation. Stop machine if anyone enters area.\n9. Always wear safety glasses or safety goggles during operation and while performing an adjustment or repair to protect your eyes. Thrown objects which ricochet can cause serious injury to the eyes.\n10. Wear sturdy, rough-soled work shoes and close-fitting slacks and shirts. Shirts and pants that cover the arms and legs and steel-toed shoes are recommended. Never operate this machine in bare feet, sandals, slippery or lightweight (e.g., canvas) shoes.\n11. Do not put hands or feet near rotating parts or under the cutting deck. Contact with blade can amputate fingers, hands, toes and feet.\n12. A missing or damaged discharge cover can cause blade contact or thrown object injuries.\n13. Many injuries occur as a result of the mower being pulled over the foot during a fall caused by slipping or tripping. Do not hold onto the mower if you are falling; release the handle immediately.\n14. Never pull the mower back toward you while you are walking. If you must back the mower away from a wall or obstruction first look down and behind to avoid tripping and then follow these steps:\n    - Step back from mower to fully extend your arms.\n    - Be sure you are well balanced with sure footing.\n    - Pull the mower back slowly, no more than halfway toward you.\n    - Repeat these steps as needed.\n15. Do not operate the mower while under the influence of alcohol or drugs.\n16. Do not engage the self-propelled mechanism on machines so equipped while starting engine.\n17. The blade control is a safety device. Never attempt to bypass its operation. Doing so makes the safety device inoperative and may result in personal injury through contact with the rotating blade. The blade control must operate easily in both directions and automatically return to the disengaged position when released.\n18. Never operate the mower in wet grass. Always be sure of your footing. A slip and fall can cause serious personal injury. If you feel you are losing your footing, release the blade control handle immediately and the blade will stop rotating within three seconds.\n19. Mow only in daylight or good artificial light. Walk, never run.\n20. Stop the blade when crossing gravel drives, walks or roads.\n21. If the equipment should start to vibrate abnormally, stop the engine and check immediately for the cause. Vibration is generally a warning of trouble.\n22. Shut the engine off and wait until the blade comes to a complete stop before removing the grass catcher or unclogging the chute. The cutting blade continues to rotate for a few seconds after the blade control is released. Never place any part of the body in the blade area until you are sure the blade has stopped rotating.\n23. Never operate mower without proper trail shield, discharge cover, grass catcher, blade control or other safety protective devices in place and working. Never operate mower with damaged safety devices. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.\n24. Muffler and engine become hot and can cause a burn. Do not touch.\n25. Never attempt to make a wheel or cutting height adjustment while the engine is running.\n26. Only use parts and accessories made for this machine by the manufacturer. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.",
            "27. When starting engine, pull cord slowly until resistance is felt, then pull rapidly. Rapid retraction of starter cord (kickback) will pull hand and arm toward engine faster than you can let go. Broken bones, fractures, bruises or sprains could result.\n28. If situations occur which are not covered in this manual, use care and good judgment. Contact Customer Support for assistance and the name of your nearest servicing dealer.",
            "### Children\n\nTragic accidents can occur if the operator is not alert to the presence of children. Children are often attracted to the mower and the mowing activity. They do not understand the dangers. Never assume that children will remain where you last saw them.\n\n1. Keep children out of the mowing area and under watchful care of a responsible adult other than the operator.\n2. Be alert and turn mower off if a child enters the area.\n3. Before and while moving backwards, look behind and down for small children.\n4. Use extreme care when approaching blind corners, doorways, shrubs, trees, or other objects that may block your vision of a child who may run into the mower.\n5. Keep children away from hot or running engines. They can suffer burns from a hot muffler.\n6. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and be trained and supervised by an adult.\n\n### Service\n\nSafe Handling of Gasoline\n\nTo avoid personal injury or property damage, use extreme care in handling gasoline. Gasoline is extremely flammable and the vapors are explosive. Serious personal injury can occur when gasoline is spilled on yourself or your clothes, which can ignite. Wash your skin and change clothes immediately.\n\n1. Use only an approved gasoline container.\n2. Never fill containers inside a vehicle or on a truck or trailer bed with a plastic liner. Always place containers on the ground away from your vehicle before filling.\n3. Remove gas-powered equipment from the truck or trailer and refuel it on the ground. If this is not possible, then refuel such equipment on a trailer with a portable container, rather than from a gasoline dispenser nozzle.\n4. Keep the nozzle in contact with the rim of the fuel tank or container opening at all times until fueling is complete. Do not use a nozzle lock-open device.\n5. Extinguish all cigarettes, cigars, pipes and other sources of ignition.\n6. Never fuel machine indoors because flammable vapors will accumulate in the area.\n7. Never remove gas cap or add fuel while the engine is hot or running. Allow engine to cool at least two minutes before refueling.\n8. Never overfill fuel tank. Fill tank to no more than \u00bd inch below bottom of filler neck to provide space for fuel expansion.\n9. Replace gasoline cap and tighten securely.\n10. If gasoline is spilled, wipe it off the engine and equipment. Move machine to another area. Wait 5 minutes before starting engine.\n11. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light (e.g. furnace, water heater, space heater, clothes dryer, etc.).\n12. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n13. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light such as a water heater, furnace, clothes dryer etc.\n14. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n\n---\n\n## General Service\n\n1. Never run an engine indoors or in a poorly ventilated area. Engine exhaust contains carbon monoxide, an odorless and deadly gas.\n2. Before cleaning, repairing, or inspecting, make certain the blade and all moving parts have stopped. Disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine to prevent unintended starting.\n3. Check the blade and engine mounting bolts at frequent intervals for proper tightness. Also, visually inspect blade for damage (e.g., bent, cracked, worn). Replace blade with the original equipment manufacturer\u2019s (O.E.M.) blade only, listed in this manual. \u201cUse of parts which do not meet the original equipment specifications may lead to improper performance and compromise safety!\u201d\n4. Mower blades are sharp and can cut. Wrap the blade or wear gloves, and use extra caution when servicing them.\n5. Keep all nuts, bolts, and screws tight to be sure the equipment is in safe working condition.\n6. Never tamper with safety devices. Check their proper operation regularly.\n7. After striking a foreign object, stop the engine, disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine. Thoroughly inspect the mower for any damage. Repair the damage before starting and operating the mower.\n8. Never attempt to make adjustments or repairs to the mower while the engine is running.\n9. Grass catcher components are subject to wear, damage and deterioration, which could expose moving parts or allow objects to be thrown. Frequently check components and replace with the manufacturer\u2019s recommended parts when necessary.\n10. Mower blades are sharp and can cut.

            "### DANGER\n\nThis machine was built to be operated according to the safe operation practices in this manual. As with any type of power equipment, carelessness or error on the part of the operator can result in serious injury. This machine is capable of amputating fingers, hands, toes and feet and throwing objects. Failure to observe the following safety instructions could result in serious injury or death.\n\n### General Operation",
            "1. Read this operator's manual carefully in its entirety before attempting to assemble this machine. Read, understand, and follow all instructions on the machine and in the manual(s) before operation. Keep this manual in a safe place for future and regular reference and for ordering replacement parts.\n2. Be completely familiar with the controls and the proper use of this machine before operating it.\n3. This machine is a precision piece of power equipment, not a plaything. Therefore, exercise extreme caution at all times. This machine has been designed to perform one job: to mow grass. Do not use it for any other purpose.\n4. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and should be trained and supervised by an adult.\n5. Only responsible individuals who are familiar with these rules of safe operation should be allowed to use this machine.\n6. Thoroughly inspect the area where the equipment is to be used. Remove all stones, sticks, wire, bones, toys and other foreign objects, which could be tripped over or picked up and thrown by the blade. Thrown objects can cause serious personal injury.\n7. Plan your mowing pattern to avoid discharge of material toward roads, sidewalks, bystanders and the like. Also, avoid discharging material against a wall or obstruction, which may cause discharged material to ricochet back toward the operator.\n8. To help avoid blade contact or a thrown object injury, stay in operator zone behind handles and keep children, bystanders, helpers and pets at least 75 feet from mower while it is in operation. Stop machine if anyone enters area.\n9. Always wear safety glasses or safety goggles during operation and while performing an adjustment or repair to protect your eyes. Thrown objects which ricochet can cause serious injury to the eyes.\n10. Wear sturdy, rough-soled work shoes and close-fitting slacks and shirts. Shirts and pants that cover the arms and legs and steel-toed shoes are recommended. Never operate this machine in bare feet, sandals, slippery or lightweight (e.g., canvas) shoes.\n11. Do not put hands or feet near rotating parts or under the cutting deck. Contact with blade can amputate fingers, hands, toes and feet.\n12. A missing or damaged discharge cover can cause blade contact or thrown object injuries.\n13. Many injuries occur as a result of the mower being pulled over the foot during a fall caused by slipping or tripping. Do not hold onto the mower if you are falling; release the handle immediately.\n14. Never pull the mower back toward you while you are walking. If you must back the mower away from a wall or obstruction first look down and behind to avoid tripping and then follow these steps:\n    - Step back from mower to fully extend your arms.\n    - Be sure you are well balanced with sure footing.\n    - Pull the mower back slowly, no more than halfway toward you.\n    - Repeat these steps as needed.\n15. Do not operate the mower while under the influence of alcohol or drugs.\n16. Do not engage the self-propelled mechanism on machines so equipped while starting engine.\n17. The blade control is a safety device. Never attempt to bypass its operation. Doing so makes the safety device inoperative and may result in personal injury through contact with the rotating blade. The blade control must operate easily in both directions and automatically return to the disengaged position when released.\n18. Never operate the mower in wet grass. Always be sure of your footing. A slip and fall can cause serious personal injury. If you feel you are losing your footing, release the blade control handle immediately and the blade will stop rotating within three seconds.\n19. Mow only in daylight or good artificial light. Walk, never run.\n20. Stop the blade when crossing gravel drives, walks or roads.\n21. If the equipment should start to vibrate abnormally, stop the engine and check immediately for the cause. Vibration is generally a warning of trouble.\n22. Shut the engine off and wait until the blade comes to a complete stop before removing the grass catcher or unclogging the chute. The cutting blade continues to rotate for a few seconds after the blade control is released. Never place any part of the body in the blade area until you are sure the blade has stopped rotating.\n23. Never operate mower without proper trail shield, discharge cover, grass catcher, blade control or other safety protective devices in place and working. Never operate mower with damaged safety devices. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.\n24. Muffler and engine become hot and can cause a burn. Do not touch.\n25. Never attempt to make a wheel or cutting height adjustment while the engine is running.\n26. Only use parts and accessories made for this machine by the manufacturer. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.",
            "27. When starting engine, pull cord slowly until resistance is felt, then pull rapidly. Rapid retraction of starter cord (kickback) will pull hand and arm toward engine faster than you can let go. Broken bones, fractures, bruises or sprains could result.\n28. If situations occur which are not covered in this manual, use care and good judgment. Contact Customer Support for assistance and the name of your nearest servicing dealer.",
            "### Children\n\nTragic accidents can occur if the operator is not alert to the presence of children. Children are often attracted to the mower and the mowing activity. They do not understand the dangers. Never assume that children will remain where you last saw them.\n\n1. Keep children out of the mowing area and under watchful care of a responsible adult other than the operator.\n2. Be alert and turn mower off if a child enters the area.\n3. Before and while moving backwards, look behind and down for small children.\n4. Use extreme care when approaching blind corners, doorways, shrubs, trees, or other objects that may block your vision of a child who may run into the mower.\n5. Keep children away from hot or running engines. They can suffer burns from a hot muffler.\n6. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and be trained and supervised by an adult.\n\n### Service\n\nSafe Handling of Gasoline\n\nTo avoid personal injury or property damage, use extreme care in handling gasoline. Gasoline is extremely flammable and the vapors are explosive. Serious personal injury can occur when gasoline is spilled on yourself or your clothes, which can ignite. Wash your skin and change clothes immediately.\n\n1. Use only an approved gasoline container.\n2. Never fill containers inside a vehicle or on a truck or trailer bed with a plastic liner. Always place containers on the ground away from your vehicle before filling.\n3. Remove gas-powered equipment from the truck or trailer and refuel it on the ground. If this is not possible, then refuel such equipment on a trailer with a portable container, rather than from a gasoline dispenser nozzle.\n4. Keep the nozzle in contact with the rim of the fuel tank or container opening at all times until fueling is complete. Do not use a nozzle lock-open device.\n5. Extinguish all cigarettes, cigars, pipes and other sources of ignition.\n6. Never fuel machine indoors because flammable vapors will accumulate in the area.\n7. Never remove gas cap or add fuel while the engine is hot or running. Allow engine to cool at least two minutes before refueling.\n8. Never overfill fuel tank. Fill tank to no more than \u00bd inch below bottom of filler neck to provide space for fuel expansion.\n9. Replace gasoline cap and tighten securely.\n10. If gasoline is spilled, wipe it off the engine and equipment. Move machine to another area. Wait 5 minutes before starting engine.\n11. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light (e.g. furnace, water heater, space heater, clothes dryer, etc.).\n12. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n13. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light such as a water heater, furnace, clothes dryer etc.\n14. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n\n---\n\n## General Service\n\n1. Never run an engine indoors or in a poorly ventilated area. Engine exhaust contains carbon monoxide, an odorless and deadly gas.\n2. Before cleaning, repairing, or inspecting, make certain the blade and all moving parts have stopped. Disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine to prevent unintended starting.\n3. Check the blade and engine mounting bolts at frequent intervals for proper tightness. Also, visually inspect blade for damage (e.g., bent, cracked, worn). Replace blade with the original equipment manufacturer\u2019s (O.E.M.) blade only, listed in this manual. \u201cUse of parts which do not meet the original equipment specifications may lead to improper performance and compromise safety!\u201d\n4. Mower blades are sharp and can cut. Wrap the blade or wear gloves, and use extra caution when servicing them.\n5. Keep all nuts, bolts, and screws tight to be sure the equipment is in safe working condition.\n6. Never tamper with safety devices. Check their proper operation regularly.\n7. After striking a foreign object, stop the engine, disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine. Thoroughly inspect the mower for any damage. Repair the damage before starting and operating the mower.\n8. Never attempt to make adjustments or repairs to the mower while the engine is running.\n9. Grass catcher components are subject to wear, damage and deterioration, which could expose moving parts or allow objects to be thrown. Frequently check components and replace with the manufacturer\u2019s recommended parts when necessary.\n10. Mower blades are sharp and can cut.

            "### DANGER\n\nThis machine was built to be operated according to the safe operation practices in this manual. As with any type of power equipment, carelessness or error on the part of the operator can result in serious injury. This machine is capable of amputating fingers, hands, toes and feet and throwing objects. Failure to observe the following safety instructions could result in serious injury or death.\n\n### General Operation",
            "1. Read this operator's manual carefully in its entirety before attempting to assemble this machine. Read, understand, and follow all instructions on the machine and in the manual(s) before operation. Keep this manual in a safe place for future and regular reference and for ordering replacement parts.\n2. Be completely familiar with the controls and the proper use of this machine before operating it.\n3. This machine is a precision piece of power equipment, not a plaything. Therefore, exercise extreme caution at all times. This machine has been designed to perform one job: to mow grass. Do not use it for any other purpose.\n4. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and should be trained and supervised by an adult.\n5. Only responsible individuals who are familiar with these rules of safe operation should be allowed to use this machine.\n6. Thoroughly inspect the area where the equipment is to be used. Remove all stones, sticks, wire, bones, toys and other foreign objects, which could be tripped over or picked up and thrown by the blade. Thrown objects can cause serious personal injury.\n7. Plan your mowing pattern to avoid discharge of material toward roads, sidewalks, bystanders and the like. Also, avoid discharging material against a wall or obstruction, which may cause discharged material to ricochet back toward the operator.\n8. To help avoid blade contact or a thrown object injury, stay in operator zone behind handles and keep children, bystanders, helpers and pets at least 75 feet from mower while it is in operation. Stop machine if anyone enters area.\n9. Always wear safety glasses or safety goggles during operation and while performing an adjustment or repair to protect your eyes. Thrown objects which ricochet can cause serious injury to the eyes.\n10. Wear sturdy, rough-soled work shoes and close-fitting slacks and shirts. Shirts and pants that cover the arms and legs and steel-toed shoes are recommended. Never operate this machine in bare feet, sandals, slippery or lightweight (e.g., canvas) shoes.\n11. Do not put hands or feet near rotating parts or under the cutting deck. Contact with blade can amputate fingers, hands, toes and feet.\n12. A missing or damaged discharge cover can cause blade contact or thrown object injuries.\n13. Many injuries occur as a result of the mower being pulled over the foot during a fall caused by slipping or tripping. Do not hold onto the mower if you are falling; release the handle immediately.\n14. Never pull the mower back toward you while you are walking. If you must back the mower away from a wall or obstruction first look down and behind to avoid tripping and then follow these steps:\n    - Step back from mower to fully extend your arms.\n    - Be sure you are well balanced with sure footing.\n    - Pull the mower back slowly, no more than halfway toward you.\n    - Repeat these steps as needed.\n15. Do not operate the mower while under the influence of alcohol or drugs.\n16. Do not engage the self-propelled mechanism on machines so equipped while starting engine.\n17. The blade control is a safety device. Never attempt to bypass its operation. Doing so makes the safety device inoperative and may result in personal injury through contact with the rotating blade. The blade control must operate easily in both directions and automatically return to the disengaged position when released.\n18. Never operate the mower in wet grass. Always be sure of your footing. A slip and fall can cause serious personal injury. If you feel you are losing your footing, release the blade control handle immediately and the blade will stop rotating within three seconds.\n19. Mow only in daylight or good artificial light. Walk, never run.\n20. Stop the blade when crossing gravel drives, walks or roads.\n21. If the equipment should start to vibrate abnormally, stop the engine and check immediately for the cause. Vibration is generally a warning of trouble.\n22. Shut the engine off and wait until the blade comes to a complete stop before removing the grass catcher or unclogging the chute. The cutting blade continues to rotate for a few seconds after the blade control is released. Never place any part of the body in the blade area until you are sure the blade has stopped rotating.\n23. Never operate mower without proper trail shield, discharge cover, grass catcher, blade control or other safety protective devices in place and working. Never operate mower with damaged safety devices. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.\n24. Muffler and engine become hot and can cause a burn. Do not touch.\n25. Never attempt to make a wheel or cutting height adjustment while the engine is running.\n26. Only use parts and accessories made for this machine by the manufacturer. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.",
            "27. When starting engine, pull cord slowly until resistance is felt, then pull rapidly. Rapid retraction of starter cord (kickback) will pull hand and arm toward engine faster than you can let go. Broken bones, fractures, bruises or sprains could result.\n28. If situations occur which are not covered in this manual, use care and good judgment. Contact Customer Support for assistance and the name of your nearest servicing dealer.",
            "### Children\n\nTragic accidents can occur if the operator is not alert to the presence of children. Children are often attracted to the mower and the mowing activity. They do not understand the dangers. Never assume that children will remain where you last saw them.\n\n1. Keep children out of the mowing area and under watchful care of a responsible adult other than the operator.\n2. Be alert and turn mower off if a child enters the area.\n3. Before and while moving backwards, look behind and down for small children.\n4. Use extreme care when approaching blind corners, doorways, shrubs, trees, or other objects that may block your vision of a child who may run into the mower.\n5. Keep children away from hot or running engines. They can suffer burns from a hot muffler.\n6. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and be trained and supervised by an adult.\n\n### Service\n\nSafe Handling of Gasoline\n\nTo avoid personal injury or property damage, use extreme care in handling gasoline. Gasoline is extremely flammable and the vapors are explosive. Serious personal injury can occur when gasoline is spilled on yourself or your clothes, which can ignite. Wash your skin and change clothes immediately.\n\n1. Use only an approved gasoline container.\n2. Never fill containers inside a vehicle or on a truck or trailer bed with a plastic liner. Always place containers on the ground away from your vehicle before filling.\n3. Remove gas-powered equipment from the truck or trailer and refuel it on the ground. If this is not possible, then refuel such equipment on a trailer with a portable container, rather than from a gasoline dispenser nozzle.\n4. Keep the nozzle in contact with the rim of the fuel tank or container opening at all times until fueling is complete. Do not use a nozzle lock-open device.\n5. Extinguish all cigarettes, cigars, pipes and other sources of ignition.\n6. Never fuel machine indoors because flammable vapors will accumulate in the area.\n7. Never remove gas cap or add fuel while the engine is hot or running. Allow engine to cool at least two minutes before refueling.\n8. Never overfill fuel tank. Fill tank to no more than \u00bd inch below bottom of filler neck to provide space for fuel expansion.\n9. Replace gasoline cap and tighten securely.\n10. If gasoline is spilled, wipe it off the engine and equipment. Move machine to another area. Wait 5 minutes before starting engine.\n11. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light (e.g. furnace, water heater, space heater, clothes dryer, etc.).\n12. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n13. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light such as a water heater, furnace, clothes dryer etc.\n14. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n\n---\n\n## General Service\n\n1. Never run an engine indoors or in a poorly ventilated area. Engine exhaust contains carbon monoxide, an odorless and deadly gas.\n2. Before cleaning, repairing, or inspecting, make certain the blade and all moving parts have stopped. Disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine to prevent unintended starting.\n3. Check the blade and engine mounting bolts at frequent intervals for proper tightness. Also, visually inspect blade for damage (e.g., bent, cracked, worn). Replace blade with the original equipment manufacturer\u2019s (O.E.M.) blade only, listed in this manual. \u201cUse of parts which do not meet the original equipment specifications may lead to improper performance and compromise safety!\u201d\n4. Mower blades are sharp and can cut. Wrap the blade or wear gloves, and use extra caution when servicing them.\n5. Keep all nuts, bolts, and screws tight to be sure the equipment is in safe working condition.\n6. Never tamper with safety devices. Check their proper operation regularly.\n7. After striking a foreign object, stop the engine, disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine. Thoroughly inspect the mower for any damage. Repair the damage before starting and operating the mower.\n8. Never attempt to make adjustments or repairs to the mower while the engine is running.\n9. Grass catcher components are subject to wear, damage and deterioration, which could expose moving parts or allow objects to be thrown. Frequently check components and replace with the manufacturer\u2019s recommended parts when necessary.\n10. Mower blades are sharp and can cut. Wrap the blade or wear gloves, and use extra caution when servicing them.\n11. Do not change the engine governor setting or over-speed the engine.

            "### DANGER\n\nThis machine was built to be operated according to the safe operation practices in this manual. As with any type of power equipment, carelessness or error on the part of the operator can result in serious injury. This machine is capable of amputating fingers, hands, toes and feet and throwing objects. Failure to observe the following safety instructions could result in serious injury or death.\n\n### General Operation",
            "1. Read this operator's manual carefully in its entirety before attempting to assemble this machine. Read, understand, and follow all instructions on the machine and in the manual(s) before operation. Keep this manual in a safe place for future and regular reference and for ordering replacement parts.\n2. Be completely familiar with the controls and the proper use of this machine before operating it.\n3. This machine is a precision piece of power equipment, not a plaything. Therefore, exercise extreme caution at all times. This machine has been designed to perform one job: to mow grass. Do not use it for any other purpose.\n4. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and should be trained and supervised by an adult.\n5. Only responsible individuals who are familiar with these rules of safe operation should be allowed to use this machine.\n6. Thoroughly inspect the area where the equipment is to be used. Remove all stones, sticks, wire, bones, toys and other foreign objects, which could be tripped over or picked up and thrown by the blade. Thrown objects can cause serious personal injury.\n7. Plan your mowing pattern to avoid discharge of material toward roads, sidewalks, bystanders and the like. Also, avoid discharging material against a wall or obstruction, which may cause discharged material to ricochet back toward the operator.\n8. To help avoid blade contact or a thrown object injury, stay in operator zone behind handles and keep children, bystanders, helpers and pets at least 75 feet from mower while it is in operation. Stop machine if anyone enters area.\n9. Always wear safety glasses or safety goggles during operation and while performing an adjustment or repair to protect your eyes. Thrown objects which ricochet can cause serious injury to the eyes.\n10. Wear sturdy, rough-soled work shoes and close-fitting slacks and shirts. Shirts and pants that cover the arms and legs and steel-toed shoes are recommended. Never operate this machine in bare feet, sandals, slippery or lightweight (e.g., canvas) shoes.\n11. Do not put hands or feet near rotating parts or under the cutting deck. Contact with blade can amputate fingers, hands, toes and feet.\n12. A missing or damaged discharge cover can cause blade contact or thrown object injuries.\n13. Many injuries occur as a result of the mower being pulled over the foot during a fall caused by slipping or tripping. Do not hold onto the mower if you are falling; release the handle immediately.\n14. Never pull the mower back toward you while you are walking. If you must back the mower away from a wall or obstruction first look down and behind to avoid tripping and then follow these steps:\n    - Step back from mower to fully extend your arms.\n    - Be sure you are well balanced with sure footing.\n    - Pull the mower back slowly, no more than halfway toward you.\n    - Repeat these steps as needed.\n15. Do not operate the mower while under the influence of alcohol or drugs.\n16. Do not engage the self-propelled mechanism on machines so equipped while starting engine.\n17. The blade control is a safety device. Never attempt to bypass its operation. Doing so makes the safety device inoperative and may result in personal injury through contact with the rotating blade. The blade control must operate easily in both directions and automatically return to the disengaged position when released.\n18. Never operate the mower in wet grass. Always be sure of your footing. A slip and fall can cause serious personal injury. If you feel you are losing your footing, release the blade control handle immediately and the blade will stop rotating within three seconds.\n19. Mow only in daylight or good artificial light. Walk, never run.\n20. Stop the blade when crossing gravel drives, walks or roads.\n21. If the equipment should start to vibrate abnormally, stop the engine and check immediately for the cause. Vibration is generally a warning of trouble.\n22. Shut the engine off and wait until the blade comes to a complete stop before removing the grass catcher or unclogging the chute. The cutting blade continues to rotate for a few seconds after the blade control is released. Never place any part of the body in the blade area until you are sure the blade has stopped rotating.\n23. Never operate mower without proper trail shield, discharge cover, grass catcher, blade control or other safety protective devices in place and working. Never operate mower with damaged safety devices. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.\n24. Muffler and engine become hot and can cause a burn. Do not touch.\n25. Never attempt to make a wheel or cutting height adjustment while the engine is running.\n26. Only use parts and accessories made for this machine by the manufacturer. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.",
            "27. When starting engine, pull cord slowly until resistance is felt, then pull rapidly. Rapid retraction of starter cord (kickback) will pull hand and arm toward engine faster than you can let go. Broken bones, fractures, bruises or sprains could result.\n28. If situations occur which are not covered in this manual, use care and good judgment. Contact Customer Support for assistance and the name of your nearest servicing dealer.",
            "### Children\n\nTragic accidents can occur if the operator is not alert to the presence of children. Children are often attracted to the mower and the mowing activity. They do not understand the dangers. Never assume that children will remain where you last saw them.\n\n1. Keep children out of the mowing area and under watchful care of a responsible adult other than the operator.\n2. Be alert and turn mower off if a child enters the area.\n3. Before and while moving backwards, look behind and down for small children.\n4. Use extreme care when approaching blind corners, doorways, shrubs, trees, or other objects that may block your vision of a child who may run into the mower.\n5. Keep children away from hot or running engines. They can suffer burns from a hot muffler.\n6. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and be trained and supervised by an adult.\n\n### Service\n\nSafe Handling of Gasoline\n\nTo avoid personal injury or property damage, use extreme care in handling gasoline. Gasoline is extremely flammable and the vapors are explosive. Serious personal injury can occur when gasoline is spilled on yourself or your clothes, which can ignite. Wash your skin and change clothes immediately.\n\n1. Use only an approved gasoline container.\n2. Never fill containers inside a vehicle or on a truck or trailer bed with a plastic liner. Always place containers on the ground away from your vehicle before filling.\n3. Remove gas-powered equipment from the truck or trailer and refuel it on the ground. If this is not possible, then refuel such equipment on a trailer with a portable container, rather than from a gasoline dispenser nozzle.\n4. Keep the nozzle in contact with the rim of the fuel tank or container opening at all times until fueling is complete. Do not use a nozzle lock-open device.\n5. Extinguish all cigarettes, cigars, pipes and other sources of ignition.\n6. Never fuel machine indoors because flammable vapors will accumulate in the area.\n7. Never remove gas cap or add fuel while the engine is hot or running. Allow engine to cool at least two minutes before refueling.\n8. Never overfill fuel tank. Fill tank to no more than \u00bd inch below bottom of filler neck to provide space for fuel expansion.\n9. Replace gasoline cap and tighten securely.\n10. If gasoline is spilled, wipe it off the engine and equipment. Move machine to another area. Wait 5 minutes before starting engine.\n11. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light (e.g. furnace, water heater, space heater, clothes dryer, etc.).\n12. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n13. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light such as a water heater, furnace, clothes dryer etc.\n14. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n\n---\n\n## General Service\n\n1. Never run an engine indoors or in a poorly ventilated area. Engine exhaust contains carbon monoxide, an odorless and deadly gas.\n2. Before cleaning, repairing, or inspecting, make certain the blade and all moving parts have stopped. Disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine to prevent unintended starting.\n3. Check the blade and engine mounting bolts at frequent intervals for proper tightness. Also, visually inspect blade for damage (e.g., bent, cracked, worn). Replace blade with the original equipment manufacturer\u2019s (O.E.M.) blade only, listed in this manual. \u201cUse of parts which do not meet the original equipment specifications may lead to improper performance and compromise safety!\u201d\n4. Mower blades are sharp and can cut. Wrap the blade or wear gloves, and use extra caution when servicing them.\n5. Keep all nuts, bolts, and screws tight to be sure the equipment is in safe working condition.\n6. Never tamper with safety devices. Check their proper operation regularly.\n7. After striking a foreign object, stop the engine, disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine. Thoroughly inspect the mower for any damage. Repair the damage before starting and operating the mower.\n8. Never attempt to make adjustments or repairs to the mower while the engine is running.\n9. Grass catcher components are subject to wear, damage and deterioration, which could expose moving parts or allow objects to be thrown. Frequently check components and replace with the manufacturer\u2019s recommended parts when necessary.\n10. Mower blades are sharp and can cut.

            "### DANGER\n\nThis machine was built to be operated according to the safe operation practices in this manual. As with any type of power equipment, carelessness or error on the part of the operator can result in serious injury. This machine is capable of amputating fingers, hands, toes and feet and throwing objects. Failure to observe the following safety instructions could result in serious injury or death.\n\n### General Operation",
            "1. Read this operator's manual carefully in its entirety before attempting to assemble this machine. Read, understand, and follow all instructions on the machine and in the manual(s) before operation. Keep this manual in a safe place for future and regular reference and for ordering replacement parts.\n2. Be completely familiar with the controls and the proper use of this machine before operating it.\n3. This machine is a precision piece of power equipment, not a plaything. Therefore, exercise extreme caution at all times. This machine has been designed to perform one job: to mow grass. Do not use it for any other purpose.\n4. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and should be trained and supervised by an adult.\n5. Only responsible individuals who are familiar with these rules of safe operation should be allowed to use this machine.\n6. Thoroughly inspect the area where the equipment is to be used. Remove all stones, sticks, wire, bones, toys and other foreign objects, which could be tripped over or picked up and thrown by the blade. Thrown objects can cause serious personal injury.\n7. Plan your mowing pattern to avoid discharge of material toward roads, sidewalks, bystanders and the like. Also, avoid discharging material against a wall or obstruction, which may cause discharged material to ricochet back toward the operator.\n8. To help avoid blade contact or a thrown object injury, stay in operator zone behind handles and keep children, bystanders, helpers and pets at least 75 feet from mower while it is in operation. Stop machine if anyone enters area.\n9. Always wear safety glasses or safety goggles during operation and while performing an adjustment or repair to protect your eyes. Thrown objects which ricochet can cause serious injury to the eyes.\n10. Wear sturdy, rough-soled work shoes and close-fitting slacks and shirts. Shirts and pants that cover the arms and legs and steel-toed shoes are recommended. Never operate this machine in bare feet, sandals, slippery or lightweight (e.g., canvas) shoes.\n11. Do not put hands or feet near rotating parts or under the cutting deck. Contact with blade can amputate fingers, hands, toes and feet.\n12. A missing or damaged discharge cover can cause blade contact or thrown object injuries.\n13. Many injuries occur as a result of the mower being pulled over the foot during a fall caused by slipping or tripping. Do not hold onto the mower if you are falling; release the handle immediately.\n14. Never pull the mower back toward you while you are walking. If you must back the mower away from a wall or obstruction first look down and behind to avoid tripping and then follow these steps:\n    - Step back from mower to fully extend your arms.\n    - Be sure you are well balanced with sure footing.\n    - Pull the mower back slowly, no more than halfway toward you.\n    - Repeat these steps as needed.\n15. Do not operate the mower while under the influence of alcohol or drugs.\n16. Do not engage the self-propelled mechanism on machines so equipped while starting engine.\n17. The blade control is a safety device. Never attempt to bypass its operation. Doing so makes the safety device inoperative and may result in personal injury through contact with the rotating blade. The blade control must operate easily in both directions and automatically return to the disengaged position when released.\n18. Never operate the mower in wet grass. Always be sure of your footing. A slip and fall can cause serious personal injury. If you feel you are losing your footing, release the blade control handle immediately and the blade will stop rotating within three seconds.\n19. Mow only in daylight or good artificial light. Walk, never run.\n20. Stop the blade when crossing gravel drives, walks or roads.\n21. If the equipment should start to vibrate abnormally, stop the engine and check immediately for the cause. Vibration is generally a warning of trouble.\n22. Shut the engine off and wait until the blade comes to a complete stop before removing the grass catcher or unclogging the chute. The cutting blade continues to rotate for a few seconds after the blade control is released. Never place any part of the body in the blade area until you are sure the blade has stopped rotating.\n23. Never operate mower without proper trail shield, discharge cover, grass catcher, blade control or other safety protective devices in place and working. Never operate mower with damaged safety devices. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.\n24. Muffler and engine become hot and can cause a burn. Do not touch.\n25. Never attempt to make a wheel or cutting height adjustment while the engine is running.\n26. Only use parts and accessories made for this machine by the manufacturer. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.",
            "27. When starting engine, pull cord slowly until resistance is felt, then pull rapidly. Rapid retraction of starter cord (kickback) will pull hand and arm toward engine faster than you can let go. Broken bones, fractures, bruises or sprains could result.\n28. If situations occur which are not covered in this manual, use care and good judgment. Contact Customer Support for assistance and the name of your nearest servicing dealer.",
            "### Children\n\nTragic accidents can occur if the operator is not alert to the presence of children. Children are often attracted to the mower and the mowing activity. They do not understand the dangers. Never assume that children will remain where you last saw them.\n\n1. Keep children out of the mowing area and under watchful care of a responsible adult other than the operator.\n2. Be alert and turn mower off if a child enters the area.\n3. Before and while moving backwards, look behind and down for small children.\n4. Use extreme care when approaching blind corners, doorways, shrubs, trees, or other objects that may block your vision of a child who may run into the mower.\n5. Keep children away from hot or running engines. They can suffer burns from a hot muffler.\n6. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and be trained and supervised by an adult.\n\n### Service\n\nSafe Handling of Gasoline\n\nTo avoid personal injury or property damage, use extreme care in handling gasoline. Gasoline is extremely flammable and the vapors are explosive. Serious personal injury can occur when gasoline is spilled on yourself or your clothes, which can ignite. Wash your skin and change clothes immediately.\n\n1. Use only an approved gasoline container.\n2. Never fill containers inside a vehicle or on a truck or trailer bed with a plastic liner. Always place containers on the ground away from your vehicle before filling.\n3. Remove gas-powered equipment from the truck or trailer and refuel it on the ground. If this is not possible, then refuel such equipment on a trailer with a portable container, rather than from a gasoline dispenser nozzle.\n4. Keep the nozzle in contact with the rim of the fuel tank or container opening at all times until fueling is complete. Do not use a nozzle lock-open device.\n5. Extinguish all cigarettes, cigars, pipes and other sources of ignition.\n6. Never fuel machine indoors because flammable vapors will accumulate in the area.\n7. Never remove gas cap or add fuel while the engine is hot or running. Allow engine to cool at least two minutes before refueling.\n8. Never overfill fuel tank. Fill tank to no more than \u00bd inch below bottom of filler neck to provide space for fuel expansion.\n9. Replace gasoline cap and tighten securely.\n10. If gasoline is spilled, wipe it off the engine and equipment. Move machine to another area. Wait 5 minutes before starting engine.\n11. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light (e.g. furnace, water heater, space heater, clothes dryer, etc.).\n12. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n13. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light such as a water heater, furnace, clothes dryer etc.\n14. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n\n---\n\n## General Service\n\n1. Never run an engine indoors or in a poorly ventilated area. Engine exhaust contains carbon monoxide, an odorless and deadly gas.\n2. Before cleaning, repairing, or inspecting, make certain the blade and all moving parts have stopped. Disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine to prevent unintended starting.\n3. Check the blade and engine mounting bolts at frequent intervals for proper tightness. Also, visually inspect blade for damage (e.g., bent, cracked, worn). Replace blade with the original equipment manufacturer\u2019s (O.E.M.) blade only, listed in this manual. \u201cUse of parts which do not meet the original equipment specifications may lead to improper performance and compromise safety!\u201d\n4. Mower blades are sharp and can cut. Wrap the blade or wear gloves, and use extra caution when servicing them.\n5. Keep all nuts, bolts, and screws tight to be sure the equipment is in safe working condition.\n6. Never tamper with safety devices. Check their proper operation regularly.\n7. After striking a foreign object, stop the engine, disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine. Thoroughly inspect the mower for any damage. Repair the damage before starting and operating the mower.\n8. Never attempt to make adjustments or repairs to the mower while the engine is running.\n9. Grass catcher components are subject to wear, damage and deterioration, which could expose moving parts or allow objects to be thrown. Frequently check components and replace with the manufacturer\u2019s recommended parts when necessary.\n10. Mower blades are sharp and can cut.

            "### DANGER\n\nThis machine was built to be operated according to the safe operation practices in this manual. As with any type of power equipment, carelessness or error on the part of the operator can result in serious injury. This machine is capable of amputating fingers, hands, toes and feet and throwing objects. Failure to observe the following safety instructions could result in serious injury or death.\n\n### General Operation",
            "1. Read this operator's manual carefully in its entirety before attempting to assemble this machine. Read, understand, and follow all instructions on the machine and in the manual(s) before operation. Keep this manual in a safe place for future and regular reference and for ordering replacement parts.\n2. Be completely familiar with the controls and the proper use of this machine before operating it.\n3. This machine is a precision piece of power equipment, not a plaything. Therefore, exercise extreme caution at all times. This machine has been designed to perform one job: to mow grass. Do not use it for any other purpose.\n4. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and should be trained and supervised by an adult.\n5. Only responsible individuals who are familiar with these rules of safe operation should be allowed to use this machine.\n6. Thoroughly inspect the area where the equipment is to be used. Remove all stones, sticks, wire, bones, toys and other foreign objects, which could be tripped over or picked up and thrown by the blade. Thrown objects can cause serious personal injury.\n7. Plan your mowing pattern to avoid discharge of material toward roads, sidewalks, bystanders and the like. Also, avoid discharging material against a wall or obstruction, which may cause discharged material to ricochet back toward the operator.\n8. To help avoid blade contact or a thrown object injury, stay in operator zone behind handles and keep children, bystanders, helpers and pets at least 75 feet from mower while it is in operation. Stop machine if anyone enters area.\n9. Always wear safety glasses or safety goggles during operation and while performing an adjustment or repair to protect your eyes. Thrown objects which ricochet can cause serious injury to the eyes.\n10. Wear sturdy, rough-soled work shoes and close-fitting slacks and shirts. Shirts and pants that cover the arms and legs and steel-toed shoes are recommended. Never operate this machine in bare feet, sandals, slippery or lightweight (e.g., canvas) shoes.\n11. Do not put hands or feet near rotating parts or under the cutting deck. Contact with blade can amputate fingers, hands, toes and feet.\n12. A missing or damaged discharge cover can cause blade contact or thrown object injuries.\n13. Many injuries occur as a result of the mower being pulled over the foot during a fall caused by slipping or tripping. Do not hold onto the mower if you are falling; release the handle immediately.\n14. Never pull the mower back toward you while you are walking. If you must back the mower away from a wall or obstruction first look down and behind to avoid tripping and then follow these steps:\n    - Step back from mower to fully extend your arms.\n    - Be sure you are well balanced with sure footing.\n    - Pull the mower back slowly, no more than halfway toward you.\n    - Repeat these steps as needed.\n15. Do not operate the mower while under the influence of alcohol or drugs.\n16. Do not engage the self-propelled mechanism on machines so equipped while starting engine.\n17. The blade control is a safety device. Never attempt to bypass its operation. Doing so makes the safety device inoperative and may result in personal injury through contact with the rotating blade. The blade control must operate easily in both directions and automatically return to the disengaged position when released.\n18. Never operate the mower in wet grass. Always be sure of your footing. A slip and fall can cause serious personal injury. If you feel you are losing your footing, release the blade control handle immediately and the blade will stop rotating within three seconds.\n19. Mow only in daylight or good artificial light. Walk, never run.\n20. Stop the blade when crossing gravel drives, walks or roads.\n21. If the equipment should start to vibrate abnormally, stop the engine and check immediately for the cause. Vibration is generally a warning of trouble.\n22. Shut the engine off and wait until the blade comes to a complete stop before removing the grass catcher or unclogging the chute. The cutting blade continues to rotate for a few seconds after the blade control is released. Never place any part of the body in the blade area until you are sure the blade has stopped rotating.\n23. Never operate mower without proper trail shield, discharge cover, grass catcher, blade control or other safety protective devices in place and working. Never operate mower with damaged safety devices. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.\n24. Muffler and engine become hot and can cause a burn. Do not touch.\n25. Never attempt to make a wheel or cutting height adjustment while the engine is running.\n26. Only use parts and accessories made for this machine by the manufacturer. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.",
            "27. When starting engine, pull cord slowly until resistance is felt, then pull rapidly. Rapid retraction of starter cord (kickback) will pull hand and arm toward engine faster than you can let go. Broken bones, fractures, bruises or sprains could result.\n28. If situations occur which are not covered in this manual, use care and good judgment. Contact Customer Support for assistance and the name of your nearest servicing dealer.",
            "### Children\n\nTragic accidents can occur if the operator is not alert to the presence of children. Children are often attracted to the mower and the mowing activity. They do not understand the dangers. Never assume that children will remain where you last saw them.\n\n1. Keep children out of the mowing area and under watchful care of a responsible adult other than the operator.\n2. Be alert and turn mower off if a child enters the area.\n3. Before and while moving backwards, look behind and down for small children.\n4. Use extreme care when approaching blind corners, doorways, shrubs, trees, or other objects that may block your vision of a child who may run into the mower.\n5. Keep children away from hot or running engines. They can suffer burns from a hot muffler.\n6. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and be trained and supervised by an adult.\n\n### Service\n\nSafe Handling of Gasoline\n\nTo avoid personal injury or property damage, use extreme care in handling gasoline. Gasoline is extremely flammable and the vapors are explosive. Serious personal injury can occur when gasoline is spilled on yourself or your clothes, which can ignite. Wash your skin and change clothes immediately.\n\n1. Use only an approved gasoline container.\n2. Never fill containers inside a vehicle or on a truck or trailer bed with a plastic liner. Always place containers on the ground away from your vehicle before filling.\n3. Remove gas-powered equipment from the truck or trailer and refuel it on the ground. If this is not possible, then refuel such equipment on a trailer with a portable container, rather than from a gasoline dispenser nozzle.\n4. Keep the nozzle in contact with the rim of the fuel tank or container opening at all times until fueling is complete. Do not use a nozzle lock-open device.\n5. Extinguish all cigarettes, cigars, pipes and other sources of ignition.\n6. Never fuel machine indoors because flammable vapors will accumulate in the area.\n7. Never remove gas cap or add fuel while the engine is hot or running. Allow engine to cool at least two minutes before refueling.\n8. Never overfill fuel tank. Fill tank to no more than \u00bd inch below bottom of filler neck to provide space for fuel expansion.\n9. Replace gasoline cap and tighten securely.\n10. If gasoline is spilled, wipe it off the engine and equipment. Move machine to another area. Wait 5 minutes before starting engine.\n11. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light (e.g. furnace, water heater, space heater, clothes dryer, etc.).\n12. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n13. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light such as a water heater, furnace, clothes dryer etc.\n14. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n\n---\n\n## General Service\n\n1. Never run an engine indoors or in a poorly ventilated area. Engine exhaust contains carbon monoxide, an odorless and deadly gas.\n2. Before cleaning, repairing, or inspecting, make certain the blade and all moving parts have stopped. Disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine to prevent unintended starting.\n3. Check the blade and engine mounting bolts at frequent intervals for proper tightness. Also, visually inspect blade for damage (e.g., bent, cracked, worn). Replace blade with the original equipment manufacturer\u2019s (O.E.M.) blade only, listed in this manual. \u201cUse of parts which do not meet the original equipment specifications may lead to improper performance and compromise safety!\u201d\n4. Mower blades are sharp and can cut. Wrap the blade or wear gloves, and use extra caution when servicing them.\n5. Keep all nuts, bolts, and screws tight to be sure the equipment is in safe working condition.\n6. Never tamper with safety devices. Check their proper operation regularly.\n7. After striking a foreign object, stop the engine, disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine. Thoroughly inspect the mower for any damage. Repair the damage before starting and operating the mower.\n8. Never attempt to make adjustments or repairs to the mower while the engine is running.\n9. Grass catcher components are subject to wear, damage and deterioration, which could expose moving parts or allow objects to be thrown. Frequently check components and replace with the manufacturer\u2019s recommended parts when necessary.\n10. Mower blades are sharp and can cut. Wrap the blade or wear gloves, and use extra caution when servicing them.\n11. Do not change the engine governor setting or over-speed the engine.

            "### DANGER\n\nThis machine was built to be operated according to the safe operation practices in this manual. As with any type of power equipment, carelessness or error on the part of the operator can result in serious injury. This machine is capable of amputating fingers, hands, toes and feet and throwing objects. Failure to observe the following safety instructions could result in serious injury or death.\n\n### General Operation",
            "1. Read this operator's manual carefully in its entirety before attempting to assemble this machine. Read, understand, and follow all instructions on the machine and in the manual(s) before operation. Keep this manual in a safe place for future and regular reference and for ordering replacement parts.\n2. Be completely familiar with the controls and the proper use of this machine before operating it.\n3. This machine is a precision piece of power equipment, not a plaything. Therefore, exercise extreme caution at all times. This machine has been designed to perform one job: to mow grass. Do not use it for any other purpose.\n4. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and should be trained and supervised by an adult.\n5. Only responsible individuals who are familiar with these rules of safe operation should be allowed to use this machine.\n6. Thoroughly inspect the area where the equipment is to be used. Remove all stones, sticks, wire, bones, toys and other foreign objects, which could be tripped over or picked up and thrown by the blade. Thrown objects can cause serious personal injury.\n7. Plan your mowing pattern to avoid discharge of material toward roads, sidewalks, bystanders and the like. Also, avoid discharging material against a wall or obstruction, which may cause discharged material to ricochet back toward the operator.\n8. To help avoid blade contact or a thrown object injury, stay in operator zone behind handles and keep children, bystanders, helpers and pets at least 75 feet from mower while it is in operation. Stop machine if anyone enters area.\n9. Always wear safety glasses or safety goggles during operation and while performing an adjustment or repair to protect your eyes. Thrown objects which ricochet can cause serious injury to the eyes.\n10. Wear sturdy, rough-soled work shoes and close-fitting slacks and shirts. Shirts and pants that cover the arms and legs and steel-toed shoes are recommended. Never operate this machine in bare feet, sandals, slippery or lightweight (e.g., canvas) shoes.\n11. Do not put hands or feet near rotating parts or under the cutting deck. Contact with blade can amputate fingers, hands, toes and feet.\n12. A missing or damaged discharge cover can cause blade contact or thrown object injuries.\n13. Many injuries occur as a result of the mower being pulled over the foot during a fall caused by slipping or tripping. Do not hold onto the mower if you are falling; release the handle immediately.\n14. Never pull the mower back toward you while you are walking. If you must back the mower away from a wall or obstruction first look down and behind to avoid tripping and then follow these steps:\n    - Step back from mower to fully extend your arms.\n    - Be sure you are well balanced with sure footing.\n    - Pull the mower back slowly, no more than halfway toward you.\n    - Repeat these steps as needed.\n15. Do not operate the mower while under the influence of alcohol or drugs.\n16. Do not engage the self-propelled mechanism on machines so equipped while starting engine.\n17. The blade control is a safety device. Never attempt to bypass its operation. Doing so makes the safety device inoperative and may result in personal injury through contact with the rotating blade. The blade control must operate easily in both directions and automatically return to the disengaged position when released.\n18. Never operate the mower in wet grass. Always be sure of your footing. A slip and fall can cause serious personal injury. If you feel you are losing your footing, release the blade control handle immediately and the blade will stop rotating within three seconds.\n19. Mow only in daylight or good artificial light. Walk, never run.\n20. Stop the blade when crossing gravel drives, walks or roads.\n21. If the equipment should start to vibrate abnormally, stop the engine and check immediately for the cause. Vibration is generally a warning of trouble.\n22. Shut the engine off and wait until the blade comes to a complete stop before removing the grass catcher or unclogging the chute. The cutting blade continues to rotate for a few seconds after the blade control is released. Never place any part of the body in the blade area until you are sure the blade has stopped rotating.\n23. Never operate mower without proper trail shield, discharge cover, grass catcher, blade control or other safety protective devices in place and working. Never operate mower with damaged safety devices. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.\n24. Muffler and engine become hot and can cause a burn. Do not touch.\n25. Never attempt to make a wheel or cutting height adjustment while the engine is running.\n26. Only use parts and accessories made for this machine by the manufacturer. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.",
            "27. When starting engine, pull cord slowly until resistance is felt, then pull rapidly. Rapid retraction of starter cord (kickback) will pull hand and arm toward engine faster than you can let go. Broken bones, fractures, bruises or sprains could result.\n28. If situations occur which are not covered in this manual, use care and good judgment. Contact Customer Support for assistance and the name of your nearest servicing dealer.",
            "### Children\n\nTragic accidents can occur if the operator is not alert to the presence of children. Children are often attracted to the mower and the mowing activity. They do not understand the dangers. Never assume that children will remain where you last saw them.\n\n1. Keep children out of the mowing area and under watchful care of a responsible adult other than the operator.\n2. Be alert and turn mower off if a child enters the area.\n3. Before and while moving backwards, look behind and down for small children.\n4. Use extreme care when approaching blind corners, doorways, shrubs, trees, or other objects that may block your vision of a child who may run into the mower.\n5. Keep children away from hot or running engines. They can suffer burns from a hot muffler.\n6. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and be trained and supervised by an adult.\n\n### Service\n\nSafe Handling of Gasoline\n\nTo avoid personal injury or property damage, use extreme care in handling gasoline. Gasoline is extremely flammable and the vapors are explosive. Serious personal injury can occur when gasoline is spilled on yourself or your clothes, which can ignite. Wash your skin and change clothes immediately.\n\n1. Use only an approved gasoline container.\n2. Never fill containers inside a vehicle or on a truck or trailer bed with a plastic liner. Always place containers on the ground away from your vehicle before filling.\n3. Remove gas-powered equipment from the truck or trailer and refuel it on the ground. If this is not possible, then refuel such equipment on a trailer with a portable container, rather than from a gasoline dispenser nozzle.\n4. Keep the nozzle in contact with the rim of the fuel tank or container opening at all times until fueling is complete. Do not use a nozzle lock-open device.\n5. Extinguish all cigarettes, cigars, pipes and other sources of ignition.\n6. Never fuel machine indoors because flammable vapors will accumulate in the area.\n7. Never remove gas cap or add fuel while the engine is hot or running. Allow engine to cool at least two minutes before refueling.\n8. Never overfill fuel tank. Fill tank to no more than \u00bd inch below bottom of filler neck to provide space for fuel expansion.\n9. Replace gasoline cap and tighten securely.\n10. If gasoline is spilled, wipe it off the engine and equipment. Move machine to another area. Wait 5 minutes before starting engine.\n11. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light (e.g. furnace, water heater, space heater, clothes dryer, etc.).\n12. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n13. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light such as a water heater, furnace, clothes dryer etc.\n14. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n\n---\n\n## General Service\n\n1. Never run an engine indoors or in a poorly ventilated area. Engine exhaust contains carbon monoxide, an odorless and deadly gas.\n2. Before cleaning, repairing, or inspecting, make certain the blade and all moving parts have stopped. Disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine to prevent unintended starting.\n3. Check the blade and engine mounting bolts at frequent intervals for proper tightness. Also, visually inspect blade for damage (e.g., bent, cracked, worn). Replace blade with the original equipment manufacturer\u2019s (O.E.M.) blade only, listed in this manual. \u201cUse of parts which do not meet the original equipment specifications may lead to improper performance and compromise safety!\u201d\n4. Mower blades are sharp and can cut. Wrap the blade or wear gloves, and use extra caution when servicing them.\n5. Keep all nuts, bolts, and screws tight to be sure the equipment is in safe working condition.\n6. Never tamper with safety devices. Check their proper operation regularly.\n7. After striking a foreign object, stop the engine, disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine. Thoroughly inspect the mower for any damage. Repair the damage before starting and operating the mower.\n8. Never attempt to make adjustments or repairs to the mower while the engine is running.\n9. Grass catcher components are subject to wear, damage and deterioration, which could expose moving parts or allow objects to be thrown. Frequently check components and replace with the manufacturer\u2019s recommended parts when necessary.\n10. Mower blades are sharp and can cut.

            "### DANGER\n\nThis machine was built to be operated according to the safe operation practices in this manual. As with any type of power equipment, carelessness or error on the part of the operator can result in serious injury. This machine is capable of amputating fingers, hands, toes and feet and throwing objects. Failure to observe the following safety instructions could result in serious injury or death.\n\n### General Operation",
            "1. Read this operator's manual carefully in its entirety before attempting to assemble this machine. Read, understand, and follow all instructions on the machine and in the manual(s) before operation. Keep this manual in a safe place for future and regular reference and for ordering replacement parts.\n2. Be completely familiar with the controls and the proper use of this machine before operating it.\n3. This machine is a precision piece of power equipment, not a plaything. Therefore, exercise extreme caution at all times. This machine has been designed to perform one job: to mow grass. Do not use it for any other purpose.\n4. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and should be trained and supervised by an adult.\n5. Only responsible individuals who are familiar with these rules of safe operation should be allowed to use this machine.\n6. Thoroughly inspect the area where the equipment is to be used. Remove all stones, sticks, wire, bones, toys and other foreign objects, which could be tripped over or picked up and thrown by the blade. Thrown objects can cause serious personal injury.\n7. Plan your mowing pattern to avoid discharge of material toward roads, sidewalks, bystanders and the like. Also, avoid discharging material against a wall or obstruction, which may cause discharged material to ricochet back toward the operator.\n8. To help avoid blade contact or a thrown object injury, stay in operator zone behind handles and keep children, bystanders, helpers and pets at least 75 feet from mower while it is in operation. Stop machine if anyone enters area.\n9. Always wear safety glasses or safety goggles during operation and while performing an adjustment or repair to protect your eyes. Thrown objects which ricochet can cause serious injury to the eyes.\n10. Wear sturdy, rough-soled work shoes and close-fitting slacks and shirts. Shirts and pants that cover the arms and legs and steel-toed shoes are recommended. Never operate this machine in bare feet, sandals, slippery or lightweight (e.g., canvas) shoes.\n11. Do not put hands or feet near rotating parts or under the cutting deck. Contact with blade can amputate fingers, hands, toes and feet.\n12. A missing or damaged discharge cover can cause blade contact or thrown object injuries.\n13. Many injuries occur as a result of the mower being pulled over the foot during a fall caused by slipping or tripping. Do not hold onto the mower if you are falling; release the handle immediately.\n14. Never pull the mower back toward you while you are walking. If you must back the mower away from a wall or obstruction first look down and behind to avoid tripping and then follow these steps:\n    - Step back from mower to fully extend your arms.\n    - Be sure you are well balanced with sure footing.\n    - Pull the mower back slowly, no more than halfway toward you.\n    - Repeat these steps as needed.\n15. Do not operate the mower while under the influence of alcohol or drugs.\n16. Do not engage the self-propelled mechanism on machines so equipped while starting engine.\n17. The blade control is a safety device. Never attempt to bypass its operation. Doing so makes the safety device inoperative and may result in personal injury through contact with the rotating blade. The blade control must operate easily in both directions and automatically return to the disengaged position when released.\n18. Never operate the mower in wet grass. Always be sure of your footing. A slip and fall can cause serious personal injury. If you feel you are losing your footing, release the blade control handle immediately and the blade will stop rotating within three seconds.\n19. Mow only in daylight or good artificial light. Walk, never run.\n20. Stop the blade when crossing gravel drives, walks or roads.\n21. If the equipment should start to vibrate abnormally, stop the engine and check immediately for the cause. Vibration is generally a warning of trouble.\n22. Shut the engine off and wait until the blade comes to a complete stop before removing the grass catcher or unclogging the chute. The cutting blade continues to rotate for a few seconds after the blade control is released. Never place any part of the body in the blade area until you are sure the blade has stopped rotating.\n23. Never operate mower without proper trail shield, discharge cover, grass catcher, blade control or other safety protective devices in place and working. Never operate mower with damaged safety devices. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.\n24. Muffler and engine become hot and can cause a burn. Do not touch.\n25. Never attempt to make a wheel or cutting height adjustment while the engine is running.\n26. Only use parts and accessories made for this machine by the manufacturer. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.",
            "27. When starting engine, pull cord slowly until resistance is felt, then pull rapidly. Rapid retraction of starter cord (kickback) will pull hand and arm toward engine faster than you can let go. Broken bones, fractures, bruises or sprains could result.\n28. If situations occur which are not covered in this manual, use care and good judgment. Contact Customer Support for assistance and the name of your nearest servicing dealer.",
            "### Children\n\nTragic accidents can occur if the operator is not alert to the presence of children. Children are often attracted to the mower and the mowing activity. They do not understand the dangers. Never assume that children will remain where you last saw them.\n\n1. Keep children out of the mowing area and under watchful care of a responsible adult other than the operator.\n2. Be alert and turn mower off if a child enters the area.\n3. Before and while moving backwards, look behind and down for small children.\n4. Use extreme care when approaching blind corners, doorways, shrubs, trees, or other objects that may block your vision of a child who may run into the mower.\n5. Keep children away from hot or running engines. They can suffer burns from a hot muffler.\n6. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and be trained and supervised by an adult.\n\n### Service\n\nSafe Handling of Gasoline\n\nTo avoid personal injury or property damage, use extreme care in handling gasoline. Gasoline is extremely flammable and the vapors are explosive. Serious personal injury can occur when gasoline is spilled on yourself or your clothes, which can ignite. Wash your skin and change clothes immediately.\n\n1. Use only an approved gasoline container.\n2. Never fill containers inside a vehicle or on a truck or trailer bed with a plastic liner. Always place containers on the ground away from your vehicle before filling.\n3. Remove gas-powered equipment from the truck or trailer and refuel it on the ground. If this is not possible, then refuel such equipment on a trailer with a portable container, rather than from a gasoline dispenser nozzle.\n4. Keep the nozzle in contact with the rim of the fuel tank or container opening at all times until fueling is complete. Do not use a nozzle lock-open device.\n5. Extinguish all cigarettes, cigars, pipes and other sources of ignition.\n6. Never fuel machine indoors because flammable vapors will accumulate in the area.\n7. Never remove gas cap or add fuel while the engine is hot or running. Allow engine to cool at least two minutes before refueling.\n8. Never overfill fuel tank. Fill tank to no more than \u00bd inch below bottom of filler neck to provide space for fuel expansion.\n9. Replace gasoline cap and tighten securely.\n10. If gasoline is spilled, wipe it off the engine and equipment. Move machine to another area. Wait 5 minutes before starting engine.\n11. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light (e.g. furnace, water heater, space heater, clothes dryer, etc.).\n12. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n13. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light such as a water heater, furnace, clothes dryer etc.\n14. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n\n---\n\n## General Service\n\n1. Never run an engine indoors or in a poorly ventilated area. Engine exhaust contains carbon monoxide, an odorless and deadly gas.\n2. Before cleaning, repairing, or inspecting, make certain the blade and all moving parts have stopped. Disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine to prevent unintended starting.\n3. Check the blade and engine mounting bolts at frequent intervals for proper tightness. Also, visually inspect blade for damage (e.g., bent, cracked, worn). Replace blade with the original equipment manufacturer\u2019s (O.E.M.) blade only, listed in this manual. \u201cUse of parts which do not meet the original equipment specifications may lead to improper performance and compromise safety!\u201d\n4. Mower blades are sharp and can cut. Wrap the blade or wear gloves, and use extra caution when servicing them.\n5. Keep all nuts, bolts, and screws tight to be sure the equipment is in safe working condition.\n6. Never tamper with safety devices. Check their proper operation regularly.\n7. After striking a foreign object, stop the engine, disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine. Thoroughly inspect the mower for any damage. Repair the damage before starting and operating the mower.\n8. Never attempt to make adjustments or repairs to the mower while the engine is running.\n9. Grass catcher components are subject to wear, damage and deterioration, which could expose moving parts or allow objects to be thrown. Frequently check components and replace with the manufacturer\u2019s recommended parts when necessary.\n10. Mower blades are sharp and can cut.

            "### DANGER\n\nThis machine was built to be operated according to the safe operation practices in this manual. As with any type of power equipment, carelessness or error on the part of the operator can result in serious injury. This machine is capable of amputating fingers, hands, toes and feet and throwing objects. Failure to observe the following safety instructions could result in serious injury or death.\n\n### General Operation",
            "1. Read this operator's manual carefully in its entirety before attempting to assemble this machine. Read, understand, and follow all instructions on the machine and in the manual(s) before operation. Keep this manual in a safe place for future and regular reference and for ordering replacement parts.\n2. Be completely familiar with the controls and the proper use of this machine before operating it.\n3. This machine is a precision piece of power equipment, not a plaything. Therefore, exercise extreme caution at all times. This machine has been designed to perform one job: to mow grass. Do not use it for any other purpose.\n4. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and should be trained and supervised by an adult.\n5. Only responsible individuals who are familiar with these rules of safe operation should be allowed to use this machine.\n6. Thoroughly inspect the area where the equipment is to be used. Remove all stones, sticks, wire, bones, toys and other foreign objects, which could be tripped over or picked up and thrown by the blade. Thrown objects can cause serious personal injury.\n7. Plan your mowing pattern to avoid discharge of material toward roads, sidewalks, bystanders and the like. Also, avoid discharging material against a wall or obstruction, which may cause discharged material to ricochet back toward the operator.\n8. To help avoid blade contact or a thrown object injury, stay in operator zone behind handles and keep children, bystanders, helpers and pets at least 75 feet from mower while it is in operation. Stop machine if anyone enters area.\n9. Always wear safety glasses or safety goggles during operation and while performing an adjustment or repair to protect your eyes. Thrown objects which ricochet can cause serious injury to the eyes.\n10. Wear sturdy, rough-soled work shoes and close-fitting slacks and shirts. Shirts and pants that cover the arms and legs and steel-toed shoes are recommended. Never operate this machine in bare feet, sandals, slippery or lightweight (e.g., canvas) shoes.\n11. Do not put hands or feet near rotating parts or under the cutting deck. Contact with blade can amputate fingers, hands, toes and feet.\n12. A missing or damaged discharge cover can cause blade contact or thrown object injuries.\n13. Many injuries occur as a result of the mower being pulled over the foot during a fall caused by slipping or tripping. Do not hold onto the mower if you are falling; release the handle immediately.\n14. Never pull the mower back toward you while you are walking. If you must back the mower away from a wall or obstruction first look down and behind to avoid tripping and then follow these steps:\n    - Step back from mower to fully extend your arms.\n    - Be sure you are well balanced with sure footing.\n    - Pull the mower back slowly, no more than halfway toward you.\n    - Repeat these steps as needed.\n15. Do not operate the mower while under the influence of alcohol or drugs.\n16. Do not engage the self-propelled mechanism on machines so equipped while starting engine.\n17. The blade control is a safety device. Never attempt to bypass its operation. Doing so makes the safety device inoperative and may result in personal injury through contact with the rotating blade. The blade control must operate easily in both directions and automatically return to the disengaged position when released.\n18. Never operate the mower in wet grass. Always be sure of your footing. A slip and fall can cause serious personal injury. If you feel you are losing your footing, release the blade control handle immediately and the blade will stop rotating within three seconds.\n19. Mow only in daylight or good artificial light. Walk, never run.\n20. Stop the blade when crossing gravel drives, walks or roads.\n21. If the equipment should start to vibrate abnormally, stop the engine and check immediately for the cause. Vibration is generally a warning of trouble.\n22. Shut the engine off and wait until the blade comes to a complete stop before removing the grass catcher or unclogging the chute. The cutting blade continues to rotate for a few seconds after the blade control is released. Never place any part of the body in the blade area until you are sure the blade has stopped rotating.\n23. Never operate mower without proper trail shield, discharge cover, grass catcher, blade control or other safety protective devices in place and working. Never operate mower with damaged safety devices. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.\n24. Muffler and engine become hot and can cause a burn. Do not touch.\n25. Never attempt to make a wheel or cutting height adjustment while the engine is running.\n26. Only use parts and accessories made for this machine by the manufacturer. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.",
            "27. When starting engine, pull cord slowly until resistance is felt, then pull rapidly. Rapid retraction of starter cord (kickback) will pull hand and arm toward engine faster than you can let go. Broken bones, fractures, bruises or sprains could result.\n28. If situations occur which are not covered in this manual, use care and good judgment. Contact Customer Support for assistance and the name of your nearest servicing dealer.",
            "### Children\n\nTragic accidents can occur if the operator is not alert to the presence of children. Children are often attracted to the mower and the mowing activity. They do not understand the dangers. Never assume that children will remain where you last saw them.\n\n1. Keep children out of the mowing area and under watchful care of a responsible adult other than the operator.\n2. Be alert and turn mower off if a child enters the area.\n3. Before and while moving backwards, look behind and down for small children.\n4. Use extreme care when approaching blind corners, doorways, shrubs, trees, or other objects that may block your vision of a child who may run into the mower.\n5. Keep children away from hot or running engines. They can suffer burns from a hot muffler.\n6. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and be trained and supervised by an adult.\n\n### Service\n\nSafe Handling of Gasoline\n\nTo avoid personal injury or property damage, use extreme care in handling gasoline. Gasoline is extremely flammable and the vapors are explosive. Serious personal injury can occur when gasoline is spilled on yourself or your clothes, which can ignite. Wash your skin and change clothes immediately.\n\n1. Use only an approved gasoline container.\n2. Never fill containers inside a vehicle or on a truck or trailer bed with a plastic liner. Always place containers on the ground away from your vehicle before filling.\n3. Remove gas-powered equipment from the truck or trailer and refuel it on the ground. If this is not possible, then refuel such equipment on a trailer with a portable container, rather than from a gasoline dispenser nozzle.\n4. Keep the nozzle in contact with the rim of the fuel tank or container opening at all times until fueling is complete. Do not use a nozzle lock-open device.\n5. Extinguish all cigarettes, cigars, pipes and other sources of ignition.\n6. Never fuel machine indoors because flammable vapors will accumulate in the area.\n7. Never remove gas cap or add fuel while the engine is hot or running. Allow engine to cool at least two minutes before refueling.\n8. Never overfill fuel tank. Fill tank to no more than \u00bd inch below bottom of filler neck to provide space for fuel expansion.\n9. Replace gasoline cap and tighten securely.\n10. If gasoline is spilled, wipe it off the engine and equipment. Move machine to another area. Wait 5 minutes before starting engine.\n11. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light (e.g. furnace, water heater, space heater, clothes dryer, etc.).\n12. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n13. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light such as a water heater, furnace, clothes dryer etc.\n14. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n\n---\n\n## General Service\n\n1. Never run an engine indoors or in a poorly ventilated area. Engine exhaust contains carbon monoxide, an odorless and deadly gas.\n2. Before cleaning, repairing, or inspecting, make certain the blade and all moving parts have stopped. Disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine to prevent unintended starting.\n3. Check the blade and engine mounting bolts at frequent intervals for proper tightness. Also, visually inspect blade for damage (e.g., bent, cracked, worn). Replace blade with the original equipment manufacturer\u2019s (O.E.M.) blade only, listed in this manual. \u201cUse of parts which do not meet the original equipment specifications may lead to improper performance and compromise safety!\u201d\n4. Mower blades are sharp and can cut. Wrap the blade or wear gloves, and use extra caution when servicing them.\n5. Keep all nuts, bolts, and screws tight to be sure the equipment is in safe working condition.\n6. Never tamper with safety devices. Check their proper operation regularly.\n7. After striking a foreign object, stop the engine, disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine. Thoroughly inspect the mower for any damage. Repair the damage before starting and operating the mower.\n8. Never attempt to make adjustments or repairs to the mower while the engine is running.\n9. Grass catcher components are subject to wear, damage and deterioration, which could expose moving parts or allow objects to be thrown. Frequently check components and replace with the manufacturer\u2019s recommended parts when necessary.\n10. Mower blades are sharp and can cut.

            "### DANGER\n\nThis machine was built to be operated according to the safe operation practices in this manual. As with any type of power equipment, carelessness or error on the part of the operator can result in serious injury. This machine is capable of amputating fingers, hands, toes and feet and throwing objects. Failure to observe the following safety instructions could result in serious injury or death.\n\n### General Operation",
            "1. Read this operator's manual carefully in its entirety before attempting to assemble this machine. Read, understand, and follow all instructions on the machine and in the manual(s) before operation. Keep this manual in a safe place for future and regular reference and for ordering replacement parts.\n2. Be completely familiar with the controls and the proper use of this machine before operating it.\n3. This machine is a precision piece of power equipment, not a plaything. Therefore, exercise extreme caution at all times. This machine has been designed to perform one job: to mow grass. Do not use it for any other purpose.\n4. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and should be trained and supervised by an adult.\n5. Only responsible individuals who are familiar with these rules of safe operation should be allowed to use this machine.\n6. Thoroughly inspect the area where the equipment is to be used. Remove all stones, sticks, wire, bones, toys and other foreign objects, which could be tripped over or picked up and thrown by the blade. Thrown objects can cause serious personal injury.\n7. Plan your mowing pattern to avoid discharge of material toward roads, sidewalks, bystanders and the like. Also, avoid discharging material against a wall or obstruction, which may cause discharged material to ricochet back toward the operator.\n8. To help avoid blade contact or a thrown object injury, stay in operator zone behind handles and keep children, bystanders, helpers and pets at least 75 feet from mower while it is in operation. Stop machine if anyone enters area.\n9. Always wear safety glasses or safety goggles during operation and while performing an adjustment or repair to protect your eyes. Thrown objects which ricochet can cause serious injury to the eyes.\n10. Wear sturdy, rough-soled work shoes and close-fitting slacks and shirts. Shirts and pants that cover the arms and legs and steel-toed shoes are recommended. Never operate this machine in bare feet, sandals, slippery or lightweight (e.g., canvas) shoes.\n11. Do not put hands or feet near rotating parts or under the cutting deck. Contact with blade can amputate fingers, hands, toes and feet.\n12. A missing or damaged discharge cover can cause blade contact or thrown object injuries.\n13. Many injuries occur as a result of the mower being pulled over the foot during a fall caused by slipping or tripping. Do not hold onto the mower if you are falling; release the handle immediately.\n14. Never pull the mower back toward you while you are walking. If you must back the mower away from a wall or obstruction first look down and behind to avoid tripping and then follow these steps:\n    - Step back from mower to fully extend your arms.\n    - Be sure you are well balanced with sure footing.\n    - Pull the mower back slowly, no more than halfway toward you.\n    - Repeat these steps as needed.\n15. Do not operate the mower while under the influence of alcohol or drugs.\n16. Do not engage the self-propelled mechanism on machines so equipped while starting engine.\n17. The blade control is a safety device. Never attempt to bypass its operation. Doing so makes the safety device inoperative and may result in personal injury through contact with the rotating blade. The blade control must operate easily in both directions and automatically return to the disengaged position when released.\n18. Never operate the mower in wet grass. Always be sure of your footing. A slip and fall can cause serious personal injury. If you feel you are losing your footing, release the blade control handle immediately and the blade will stop rotating within three seconds.\n19. Mow only in daylight or good artificial light. Walk, never run.\n20. Stop the blade when crossing gravel drives, walks or roads.\n21. If the equipment should start to vibrate abnormally, stop the engine and check immediately for the cause. Vibration is generally a warning of trouble.\n22. Shut the engine off and wait until the blade comes to a complete stop before removing the grass catcher or unclogging the chute. The cutting blade continues to rotate for a few seconds after the blade control is released. Never place any part of the body in the blade area until you are sure the blade has stopped rotating.\n23. Never operate mower without proper trail shield, discharge cover, grass catcher, blade control or other safety protective devices in place and working. Never operate mower with damaged safety devices. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.\n24. Muffler and engine become hot and can cause a burn. Do not touch.\n25. Never attempt to make a wheel or cutting height adjustment while the engine is running.\n26. Only use parts and accessories made for this machine by the manufacturer. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.",
            "27. When starting engine, pull cord slowly until resistance is felt, then pull rapidly. Rapid retraction of starter cord (kickback) will pull hand and arm toward engine faster than you can let go. Broken bones, fractures, bruises or sprains could result.\n28. If situations occur which are not covered in this manual, use care and good judgment. Contact Customer Support for assistance and the name of your nearest servicing dealer.",
            "### Children\n\nTragic accidents can occur if the operator is not alert to the presence of children. Children are often attracted to the mower and the mowing activity. They do not understand the dangers. Never assume that children will remain where you last saw them.\n\n1. Keep children out of the mowing area and under watchful care of a responsible adult other than the operator.\n2. Be alert and turn mower off if a child enters the area.\n3. Before and while moving backwards, look behind and down for small children.\n4. Use extreme care when approaching blind corners, doorways, shrubs, trees, or other objects that may block your vision of a child who may run into the mower.\n5. Keep children away from hot or running engines. They can suffer burns from a hot muffler.\n6. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and be trained and supervised by an adult.\n\n### Service\n\nSafe Handling of Gasoline\n\nTo avoid personal injury or property damage, use extreme care in handling gasoline. Gasoline is extremely flammable and the vapors are explosive. Serious personal injury can occur when gasoline is spilled on yourself or your clothes, which can ignite. Wash your skin and change clothes immediately.\n\n1. Use only an approved gasoline container.\n2. Never fill containers inside a vehicle or on a truck or trailer bed with a plastic liner. Always place containers on the ground away from your vehicle before filling.\n3. Remove gas-powered equipment from the truck or trailer and refuel it on the ground. If this is not possible, then refuel such equipment on a trailer with a portable container, rather than from a gasoline dispenser nozzle.\n4. Keep the nozzle in contact with the rim of the fuel tank or container opening at all times until fueling is complete. Do not use a nozzle lock-open device.\n5. Extinguish all cigarettes, cigars, pipes and other sources of ignition.\n6. Never fuel machine indoors because flammable vapors will accumulate in the area.\n7. Never remove gas cap or add fuel while the engine is hot or running. Allow engine to cool at least two minutes before refueling.\n8. Never overfill fuel tank. Fill tank to no more than \u00bd inch below bottom of filler neck to provide space for fuel expansion.\n9. Replace gasoline cap and tighten securely.\n10. If gasoline is spilled, wipe it off the engine and equipment. Move machine to another area. Wait 5 minutes before starting engine.\n11. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light (e.g. furnace, water heater, space heater, clothes dryer, etc.).\n12. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n13. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light such as a water heater, furnace, clothes dryer etc.\n14. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n\n---\n\n## General Service\n\n1. Never run an engine indoors or in a poorly ventilated area. Engine exhaust contains carbon monoxide, an odorless and deadly gas.\n2. Before cleaning, repairing, or inspecting, make certain the blade and all moving parts have stopped. Disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine to prevent unintended starting.\n3. Check the blade and engine mounting bolts at frequent intervals for proper tightness. Also, visually inspect blade for damage (e.g., bent, cracked, worn). Replace blade with the original equipment manufacturer\u2019s (O.E.M.) blade only, listed in this manual. \u201cUse of parts which do not meet the original equipment specifications may lead to improper performance and compromise safety!\u201d\n4. Mower blades are sharp and can cut. Wrap the blade or wear gloves, and use extra caution when servicing them.\n5. Keep all nuts, bolts, and screws tight to be sure the equipment is in safe working condition.\n6. Never tamper with safety devices. Check their proper operation regularly.\n7. After striking a foreign object, stop the engine, disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine. Thoroughly inspect the mower for any damage. Repair the damage before starting and operating the mower.\n8. Never attempt to make adjustments or repairs to the mower while the engine is running.\n9. Grass catcher components are subject to wear, damage and deterioration, which could expose moving parts or allow objects to be thrown. Frequently check components and replace with the manufacturer\u2019s recommended parts when necessary.\n10. Mower blades are sharp and can cut.

            "### DANGER\n\nThis machine was built to be operated according to the safe operation practices in this manual. As with any type of power equipment, carelessness or error on the part of the operator can result in serious injury. This machine is capable of amputating fingers, hands, toes and feet and throwing objects. Failure to observe the following safety instructions could result in serious injury or death.\n\n### General Operation",
            "1. Read this operator's manual carefully in its entirety before attempting to assemble this machine. Read, understand, and follow all instructions on the machine and in the manual(s) before operation. Keep this manual in a safe place for future and regular reference and for ordering replacement parts.\n2. Be completely familiar with the controls and the proper use of this machine before operating it.\n3. This machine is a precision piece of power equipment, not a plaything. Therefore, exercise extreme caution at all times. This machine has been designed to perform one job: to mow grass. Do not use it for any other purpose.\n4. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and should be trained and supervised by an adult.\n5. Only responsible individuals who are familiar with these rules of safe operation should be allowed to use this machine.\n6. Thoroughly inspect the area where the equipment is to be used. Remove all stones, sticks, wire, bones, toys and other foreign objects, which could be tripped over or picked up and thrown by the blade. Thrown objects can cause serious personal injury.\n7. Plan your mowing pattern to avoid discharge of material toward roads, sidewalks, bystanders and the like. Also, avoid discharging material against a wall or obstruction, which may cause discharged material to ricochet back toward the operator.\n8. To help avoid blade contact or a thrown object injury, stay in operator zone behind handles and keep children, bystanders, helpers and pets at least 75 feet from mower while it is in operation. Stop machine if anyone enters area.\n9. Always wear safety glasses or safety goggles during operation and while performing an adjustment or repair to protect your eyes. Thrown objects which ricochet can cause serious injury to the eyes.\n10. Wear sturdy, rough-soled work shoes and close-fitting slacks and shirts. Shirts and pants that cover the arms and legs and steel-toed shoes are recommended. Never operate this machine in bare feet, sandals, slippery or lightweight (e.g., canvas) shoes.\n11. Do not put hands or feet near rotating parts or under the cutting deck. Contact with blade can amputate fingers, hands, toes and feet.\n12. A missing or damaged discharge cover can cause blade contact or thrown object injuries.\n13. Many injuries occur as a result of the mower being pulled over the foot during a fall caused by slipping or tripping. Do not hold onto the mower if you are falling; release the handle immediately.\n14. Never pull the mower back toward you while you are walking. If you must back the mower away from a wall or obstruction first look down and behind to avoid tripping and then follow these steps:\n    - Step back from mower to fully extend your arms.\n    - Be sure you are well balanced with sure footing.\n    - Pull the mower back slowly, no more than halfway toward you.\n    - Repeat these steps as needed.\n15. Do not operate the mower while under the influence of alcohol or drugs.\n16. Do not engage the self-propelled mechanism on machines so equipped while starting engine.\n17. The blade control is a safety device. Never attempt to bypass its operation. Doing so makes the safety device inoperative and may result in personal injury through contact with the rotating blade. The blade control must operate easily in both directions and automatically return to the disengaged position when released.\n18. Never operate the mower in wet grass. Always be sure of your footing. A slip and fall can cause serious personal injury. If you feel you are losing your footing, release the blade control handle immediately and the blade will stop rotating within three seconds.\n19. Mow only in daylight or good artificial light. Walk, never run.\n20. Stop the blade when crossing gravel drives, walks or roads.\n21. If the equipment should start to vibrate abnormally, stop the engine and check immediately for the cause. Vibration is generally a warning of trouble.\n22. Shut the engine off and wait until the blade comes to a complete stop before removing the grass catcher or unclogging the chute. The cutting blade continues to rotate for a few seconds after the blade control is released. Never place any part of the body in the blade area until you are sure the blade has stopped rotating.\n23. Never operate mower without proper trail shield, discharge cover, grass catcher, blade control or other safety protective devices in place and working. Never operate mower with damaged safety devices. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.\n24. Muffler and engine become hot and can cause a burn. Do not touch.\n25. Never attempt to make a wheel or cutting height adjustment while the engine is running.\n26. Only use parts and accessories made for this machine by the manufacturer. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.",
            "27. When starting engine, pull cord slowly until resistance is felt, then pull rapidly. Rapid retraction of starter cord (kickback) will pull hand and arm toward engine faster than you can let go. Broken bones, fractures, bruises or sprains could result.\n28. If situations occur which are not covered in this manual, use care and good judgment. Contact Customer Support for assistance and the name of your nearest servicing dealer.",
            "### Children\n\nTragic accidents can occur if the operator is not alert to the presence of children. Children are often attracted to the mower and the mowing activity. They do not understand the dangers. Never assume that children will remain where you last saw them.\n\n1. Keep children out of the mowing area and under watchful care of a responsible adult other than the operator.\n2. Be alert and turn mower off if a child enters the area.\n3. Before and while moving backwards, look behind and down for small children.\n4. Use extreme care when approaching blind corners, doorways, shrubs, trees, or other objects that may block your vision of a child who may run into the mower.\n5. Keep children away from hot or running engines. They can suffer burns from a hot muffler.\n6. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and be trained and supervised by an adult.\n\n### Service\n\nSafe Handling of Gasoline\n\nTo avoid personal injury or property damage, use extreme care in handling gasoline. Gasoline is extremely flammable and the vapors are explosive. Serious personal injury can occur when gasoline is spilled on yourself or your clothes, which can ignite. Wash your skin and change clothes immediately.\n\n1. Use only an approved gasoline container.\n2. Never fill containers inside a vehicle or on a truck or trailer bed with a plastic liner. Always place containers on the ground away from your vehicle before filling.\n3. Remove gas-powered equipment from the truck or trailer and refuel it on the ground. If this is not possible, then refuel such equipment on a trailer with a portable container, rather than from a gasoline dispenser nozzle.\n4. Keep the nozzle in contact with the rim of the fuel tank or container opening at all times until fueling is complete. Do not use a nozzle lock-open device.\n5. Extinguish all cigarettes, cigars, pipes and other sources of ignition.\n6. Never fuel machine indoors because flammable vapors will accumulate in the area.\n7. Never remove gas cap or add fuel while the engine is hot or running. Allow engine to cool at least two minutes before refueling.\n8. Never overfill fuel tank. Fill tank to no more than \u00bd inch below bottom of filler neck to provide space for fuel expansion.\n9. Replace gasoline cap and tighten securely.\n10. If gasoline is spilled, wipe it off the engine and equipment. Move machine to another area. Wait 5 minutes before starting engine.\n11. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light (e.g. furnace, water heater, space heater, clothes dryer, etc.).\n12. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n13. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light such as a water heater, furnace, clothes dryer etc.\n14. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n\n---\n\n## General Service\n\n1. Never run an engine indoors or in a poorly ventilated area. Engine exhaust contains carbon monoxide, an odorless and deadly gas.\n2. Before cleaning, repairing, or inspecting, make certain the blade and all moving parts have stopped. Disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine to prevent unintended starting.\n3. Check the blade and engine mounting bolts at frequent intervals for proper tightness. Also, visually inspect blade for damage (e.g., bent, cracked, worn). Replace blade with the original equipment manufacturer\u2019s (O.E.M.) blade only, listed in this manual. \u201cUse of parts which do not meet the original equipment specifications may lead to improper performance and compromise safety!\u201d\n4. Mower blades are sharp and can cut. Wrap the blade or wear gloves, and use extra caution when servicing them.\n5. Keep all nuts, bolts, and screws tight to be sure the equipment is in safe working condition.\n6. Never tamper with safety devices. Check their proper operation regularly.\n7. After striking a foreign object, stop the engine, disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine. Thoroughly inspect the mower for any damage. Repair the damage before starting and operating the mower.\n8. Never attempt to make adjustments or repairs to the mower while the engine is running.\n9. Grass catcher components are subject to wear, damage and deterioration, which could expose moving parts or allow objects to be thrown. Frequently check components and replace with the manufacturer\u2019s recommended parts when necessary.\n10. Mower blades are sharp and can cut.

            "### DANGER\n\nThis machine was built to be operated according to the safe operation practices in this manual. As with any type of power equipment, carelessness or error on the part of the operator can result in serious injury. This machine is capable of amputating fingers, hands, toes and feet and throwing objects. Failure to observe the following safety instructions could result in serious injury or death.\n\n### General Operation",
            "1. Read this operator's manual carefully in its entirety before attempting to assemble this machine. Read, understand, and follow all instructions on the machine and in the manual(s) before operation. Keep this manual in a safe place for future and regular reference and for ordering replacement parts.\n2. Be completely familiar with the controls and the proper use of this machine before operating it.\n3. This machine is a precision piece of power equipment, not a plaything. Therefore, exercise extreme caution at all times. This machine has been designed to perform one job: to mow grass. Do not use it for any other purpose.\n4. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and should be trained and supervised by an adult.\n5. Only responsible individuals who are familiar with these rules of safe operation should be allowed to use this machine.\n6. Thoroughly inspect the area where the equipment is to be used. Remove all stones, sticks, wire, bones, toys and other foreign objects, which could be tripped over or picked up and thrown by the blade. Thrown objects can cause serious personal injury.\n7. Plan your mowing pattern to avoid discharge of material toward roads, sidewalks, bystanders and the like. Also, avoid discharging material against a wall or obstruction, which may cause discharged material to ricochet back toward the operator.\n8. To help avoid blade contact or a thrown object injury, stay in operator zone behind handles and keep children, bystanders, helpers and pets at least 75 feet from mower while it is in operation. Stop machine if anyone enters area.\n9. Always wear safety glasses or safety goggles during operation and while performing an adjustment or repair to protect your eyes. Thrown objects which ricochet can cause serious injury to the eyes.\n10. Wear sturdy, rough-soled work shoes and close-fitting slacks and shirts. Shirts and pants that cover the arms and legs and steel-toed shoes are recommended. Never operate this machine in bare feet, sandals, slippery or lightweight (e.g., canvas) shoes.\n11. Do not put hands or feet near rotating parts or under the cutting deck. Contact with blade can amputate fingers, hands, toes and feet.\n12. A missing or damaged discharge cover can cause blade contact or thrown object injuries.\n13. Many injuries occur as a result of the mower being pulled over the foot during a fall caused by slipping or tripping. Do not hold onto the mower if you are falling; release the handle immediately.\n14. Never pull the mower back toward you while you are walking. If you must back the mower away from a wall or obstruction first look down and behind to avoid tripping and then follow these steps:\n    - Step back from mower to fully extend your arms.\n    - Be sure you are well balanced with sure footing.\n    - Pull the mower back slowly, no more than halfway toward you.\n    - Repeat these steps as needed.\n15. Do not operate the mower while under the influence of alcohol or drugs.\n16. Do not engage the self-propelled mechanism on machines so equipped while starting engine.\n17. The blade control is a safety device. Never attempt to bypass its operation. Doing so makes the safety device inoperative and may result in personal injury through contact with the rotating blade. The blade control must operate easily in both directions and automatically return to the disengaged position when released.\n18. Never operate the mower in wet grass. Always be sure of your footing. A slip and fall can cause serious personal injury. If you feel you are losing your footing, release the blade control handle immediately and the blade will stop rotating within three seconds.\n19. Mow only in daylight or good artificial light. Walk, never run.\n20. Stop the blade when crossing gravel drives, walks or roads.\n21. If the equipment should start to vibrate abnormally, stop the engine and check immediately for the cause. Vibration is generally a warning of trouble.\n22. Shut the engine off and wait until the blade comes to a complete stop before removing the grass catcher or unclogging the chute. The cutting blade continues to rotate for a few seconds after the blade control is released. Never place any part of the body in the blade area until you are sure the blade has stopped rotating.\n23. Never operate mower without proper trail shield, discharge cover, grass catcher, blade control or other safety protective devices in place and working. Never operate mower with damaged safety devices. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.\n24. Muffler and engine become hot and can cause a burn. Do not touch.\n25. Never attempt to make a wheel or cutting height adjustment while the engine is running.\n26. Only use parts and accessories made for this machine by the manufacturer. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.",
            "27. When starting engine, pull cord slowly until resistance is felt, then pull rapidly. Rapid retraction of starter cord (kickback) will pull hand and arm toward engine faster than you can let go. Broken bones, fractures, bruises or sprains could result.\n28. If situations occur which are not covered in this manual, use care and good judgment. Contact Customer Support for assistance and the name of your nearest servicing dealer.",
            "### Children\n\nTragic accidents can occur if the operator is not alert to the presence of children. Children are often attracted to the mower and the mowing activity. They do not understand the dangers. Never assume that children will remain where you last saw them.\n\n1. Keep children out of the mowing area and under watchful care of a responsible adult other than the operator.\n2. Be alert and turn mower off if a child enters the area.\n3. Before and while moving backwards, look behind and down for small children.\n4. Use extreme care when approaching blind corners, doorways, shrubs, trees, or other objects that may block your vision of a child who may run into the mower.\n5. Keep children away from hot or running engines. They can suffer burns from a hot muffler.\n6. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and be trained and supervised by an adult.\n\n### Service\n\nSafe Handling of Gasoline\n\nTo avoid personal injury or property damage, use extreme care in handling gasoline. Gasoline is extremely flammable and the vapors are explosive. Serious personal injury can occur when gasoline is spilled on yourself or your clothes, which can ignite. Wash your skin and change clothes immediately.\n\n1. Use only an approved gasoline container.\n2. Never fill containers inside a vehicle or on a truck or trailer bed with a plastic liner. Always place containers on the ground away from your vehicle before filling.\n3. Remove gas-powered equipment from the truck or trailer and refuel it on the ground. If this is not possible, then refuel such equipment on a trailer with a portable container, rather than from a gasoline dispenser nozzle.\n4. Keep the nozzle in contact with the rim of the fuel tank or container opening at all times until fueling is complete. Do not use a nozzle lock-open device.\n5. Extinguish all cigarettes, cigars, pipes and other sources of ignition.\n6. Never fuel machine indoors because flammable vapors will accumulate in the area.\n7. Never remove gas cap or add fuel while the engine is hot or running. Allow engine to cool at least two minutes before refueling.\n8. Never overfill fuel tank. Fill tank to no more than \u00bd inch below bottom of filler neck to provide space for fuel expansion.\n9. Replace gasoline cap and tighten securely.\n10. If gasoline is spilled, wipe it off the engine and equipment. Move machine to another area. Wait 5 minutes before starting engine.\n11. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light (e.g. furnace, water heater, space heater, clothes dryer, etc.).\n12. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n13. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light such as a water heater, furnace, clothes dryer etc.\n14. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n\n---\n\n## General Service\n\n1. Never run an engine indoors or in a poorly ventilated area. Engine exhaust contains carbon monoxide, an odorless and deadly gas.\n2. Before cleaning, repairing, or inspecting, make certain the blade and all moving parts have stopped. Disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine to prevent unintended starting.\n3. Check the blade and engine mounting bolts at frequent intervals for proper tightness. Also, visually inspect blade for damage (e.g., bent, cracked, worn). Replace blade with the original equipment manufacturer\u2019s (O.E.M.) blade only, listed in this manual. \u201cUse of parts which do not meet the original equipment specifications may lead to improper performance and compromise safety!\u201d\n4. Mower blades are sharp and can cut. Wrap the blade or wear gloves, and use extra caution when servicing them.\n5. Keep all nuts, bolts, and screws tight to be sure the equipment is in safe working condition.\n6. Never tamper with safety devices. Check their proper operation regularly.\n7. After striking a foreign object, stop the engine, disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine. Thoroughly inspect the mower for any damage. Repair the damage before starting and operating the mower.\n8. Never attempt to make adjustments or repairs to the mower while the engine is running.\n9. Grass catcher components are subject to wear, damage and deterioration, which could expose moving parts or allow objects to be thrown. Frequently check components and replace with the manufacturer\u2019s recommended parts when necessary.\n10. Mower blades are sharp and can cut. Wrap the blade or wear gloves, and use extra caution when servicing them.\n11. Do not change the engine governor setting or over-speed the engine.

            "### DANGER\n\nThis machine was built to be operated according to the safe operation practices in this manual. As with any type of power equipment, carelessness or error on the part of the operator can result in serious injury. This machine is capable of amputating fingers, hands, toes and feet and throwing objects. Failure to observe the following safety instructions could result in serious injury or death.\n\n### General Operation",
            "1. Read this operator's manual carefully in its entirety before attempting to assemble this machine. Read, understand, and follow all instructions on the machine and in the manual(s) before operation. Keep this manual in a safe place for future and regular reference and for ordering replacement parts.\n2. Be completely familiar with the controls and the proper use of this machine before operating it.\n3. This machine is a precision piece of power equipment, not a plaything. Therefore, exercise extreme caution at all times. This machine has been designed to perform one job: to mow grass. Do not use it for any other purpose.\n4. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and should be trained and supervised by an adult.\n5. Only responsible individuals who are familiar with these rules of safe operation should be allowed to use this machine.\n6. Thoroughly inspect the area where the equipment is to be used. Remove all stones, sticks, wire, bones, toys and other foreign objects, which could be tripped over or picked up and thrown by the blade. Thrown objects can cause serious personal injury.\n7. Plan your mowing pattern to avoid discharge of material toward roads, sidewalks, bystanders and the like. Also, avoid discharging material against a wall or obstruction, which may cause discharged material to ricochet back toward the operator.\n8. To help avoid blade contact or a thrown object injury, stay in operator zone behind handles and keep children, bystanders, helpers and pets at least 75 feet from mower while it is in operation. Stop machine if anyone enters area.\n9. Always wear safety glasses or safety goggles during operation and while performing an adjustment or repair to protect your eyes. Thrown objects which ricochet can cause serious injury to the eyes.\n10. Wear sturdy, rough-soled work shoes and close-fitting slacks and shirts. Shirts and pants that cover the arms and legs and steel-toed shoes are recommended. Never operate this machine in bare feet, sandals, slippery or lightweight (e.g., canvas) shoes.\n11. Do not put hands or feet near rotating parts or under the cutting deck. Contact with blade can amputate fingers, hands, toes and feet.\n12. A missing or damaged discharge cover can cause blade contact or thrown object injuries.\n13. Many injuries occur as a result of the mower being pulled over the foot during a fall caused by slipping or tripping. Do not hold onto the mower if you are falling; release the handle immediately.\n14. Never pull the mower back toward you while you are walking. If you must back the mower away from a wall or obstruction first look down and behind to avoid tripping and then follow these steps:\n    - Step back from mower to fully extend your arms.\n    - Be sure you are well balanced with sure footing.\n    - Pull the mower back slowly, no more than halfway toward you.\n    - Repeat these steps as needed.\n15. Do not operate the mower while under the influence of alcohol or drugs.\n16. Do not engage the self-propelled mechanism on machines so equipped while starting engine.\n17. The blade control is a safety device. Never attempt to bypass its operation. Doing so makes the safety device inoperative and may result in personal injury through contact with the rotating blade. The blade control must operate easily in both directions and automatically return to the disengaged position when released.\n18. Never operate the mower in wet grass. Always be sure of your footing. A slip and fall can cause serious personal injury. If you feel you are losing your footing, release the blade control handle immediately and the blade will stop rotating within three seconds.\n19. Mow only in daylight or good artificial light. Walk, never run.\n20. Stop the blade when crossing gravel drives, walks or roads.\n21. If the equipment should start to vibrate abnormally, stop the engine and check immediately for the cause. Vibration is generally a warning of trouble.\n22. Shut the engine off and wait until the blade comes to a complete stop before removing the grass catcher or unclogging the chute. The cutting blade continues to rotate for a few seconds after the blade control is released. Never place any part of the body in the blade area until you are sure the blade has stopped rotating.\n23. Never operate mower without proper trail shield, discharge cover, grass catcher, blade control or other safety protective devices in place and working. Never operate mower with damaged safety devices. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.\n24. Muffler and engine become hot and can cause a burn. Do not touch.\n25. Never attempt to make a wheel or cutting height adjustment while the engine is running.\n26. Only use parts and accessories made for this machine by the manufacturer. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.",
            "27. When starting engine, pull cord slowly until resistance is felt, then pull rapidly. Rapid retraction of starter cord (kickback) will pull hand and arm toward engine faster than you can let go. Broken bones, fractures, bruises or sprains could result.\n28. If situations occur which are not covered in this manual, use care and good judgment. Contact Customer Support for assistance and the name of your nearest servicing dealer.",
            "### Children\n\nTragic accidents can occur if the operator is not alert to the presence of children. Children are often attracted to the mower and the mowing activity. They do not understand the dangers. Never assume that children will remain where you last saw them.\n\n1. Keep children out of the mowing area and under watchful care of a responsible adult other than the operator.\n2. Be alert and turn mower off if a child enters the area.\n3. Before and while moving backwards, look behind and down for small children.\n4. Use extreme care when approaching blind corners, doorways, shrubs, trees, or other objects that may block your vision of a child who may run into the mower.\n5. Keep children away from hot or running engines. They can suffer burns from a hot muffler.\n6. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and be trained and supervised by an adult.\n\n### Service\n\nSafe Handling of Gasoline\n\nTo avoid personal injury or property damage, use extreme care in handling gasoline. Gasoline is extremely flammable and the vapors are explosive. Serious personal injury can occur when gasoline is spilled on yourself or your clothes, which can ignite. Wash your skin and change clothes immediately.\n\n1. Use only an approved gasoline container.\n2. Never fill containers inside a vehicle or on a truck or trailer bed with a plastic liner. Always place containers on the ground away from your vehicle before filling.\n3. Remove gas-powered equipment from the truck or trailer and refuel it on the ground. If this is not possible, then refuel such equipment on a trailer with a portable container, rather than from a gasoline dispenser nozzle.\n4. Keep the nozzle in contact with the rim of the fuel tank or container opening at all times until fueling is complete. Do not use a nozzle lock-open device.\n5. Extinguish all cigarettes, cigars, pipes and other sources of ignition.\n6. Never fuel machine indoors because flammable vapors will accumulate in the area.\n7. Never remove gas cap or add fuel while the engine is hot or running. Allow engine to cool at least two minutes before refueling.\n8. Never overfill fuel tank. Fill tank to no more than \u00bd inch below bottom of filler neck to provide space for fuel expansion.\n9. Replace gasoline cap and tighten securely.\n10. If gasoline is spilled, wipe it off the engine and equipment. Move machine to another area. Wait 5 minutes before starting engine.\n11. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light (e.g. furnace, water heater, space heater, clothes dryer, etc.).\n12. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n13. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light such as a water heater, furnace, clothes dryer etc.\n14. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n\n---\n\n## General Service\n\n1. Never run an engine indoors or in a poorly ventilated area. Engine exhaust contains carbon monoxide, an odorless and deadly gas.\n2. Before cleaning, repairing, or inspecting, make certain the blade and all moving parts have stopped. Disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine to prevent unintended starting.\n3. Check the blade and engine mounting bolts at frequent intervals for proper tightness. Also, visually inspect blade for damage (e.g., bent, cracked, worn). Replace blade with the original equipment manufacturer\u2019s (O.E.M.) blade only, listed in this manual. \u201cUse of parts which do not meet the original equipment specifications may lead to improper performance and compromise safety!\u201d\n4. Mower blades are sharp and can cut. Wrap the blade or wear gloves, and use extra caution when servicing them.\n5. Keep all nuts, bolts, and screws tight to be sure the equipment is in safe working condition.\n6. Never tamper with safety devices. Check their proper operation regularly.\n7. After striking a foreign object, stop the engine, disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine. Thoroughly inspect the mower for any damage. Repair the damage before starting and operating the mower.\n8. Never attempt to make adjustments or repairs to the mower while the engine is running.\n9. Grass catcher components are subject to wear, damage and deterioration, which could expose moving parts or allow objects to be thrown. Frequently check components and replace with the manufacturer\u2019s recommended parts when necessary.\n10. Mower blades are sharp and can cut.

            "### DANGER\n\nThis machine was built to be operated according to the safe operation practices in this manual. As with any type of power equipment, carelessness or error on the part of the operator can result in serious injury. This machine is capable of amputating fingers, hands, toes and feet and throwing objects. Failure to observe the following safety instructions could result in serious injury or death.\n\n### General Operation",
            "1. Read this operator's manual carefully in its entirety before attempting to assemble this machine. Read, understand, and follow all instructions on the machine and in the manual(s) before operation. Keep this manual in a safe place for future and regular reference and for ordering replacement parts.\n2. Be completely familiar with the controls and the proper use of this machine before operating it.\n3. This machine is a precision piece of power equipment, not a plaything. Therefore, exercise extreme caution at all times. This machine has been designed to perform one job: to mow grass. Do not use it for any other purpose.\n4. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and should be trained and supervised by an adult.\n5. Only responsible individuals who are familiar with these rules of safe operation should be allowed to use this machine.\n6. Thoroughly inspect the area where the equipment is to be used. Remove all stones, sticks, wire, bones, toys and other foreign objects, which could be tripped over or picked up and thrown by the blade. Thrown objects can cause serious personal injury.\n7. Plan your mowing pattern to avoid discharge of material toward roads, sidewalks, bystanders and the like. Also, avoid discharging material against a wall or obstruction, which may cause discharged material to ricochet back toward the operator.\n8. To help avoid blade contact or a thrown object injury, stay in operator zone behind handles and keep children, bystanders, helpers and pets at least 75 feet from mower while it is in operation. Stop machine if anyone enters area.\n9. Always wear safety glasses or safety goggles during operation and while performing an adjustment or repair to protect your eyes. Thrown objects which ricochet can cause serious injury to the eyes.\n10. Wear sturdy, rough-soled work shoes and close-fitting slacks and shirts. Shirts and pants that cover the arms and legs and steel-toed shoes are recommended. Never operate this machine in bare feet, sandals, slippery or lightweight (e.g., canvas) shoes.\n11. Do not put hands or feet near rotating parts or under the cutting deck. Contact with blade can amputate fingers, hands, toes and feet.\n12. A missing or damaged discharge cover can cause blade contact or thrown object injuries.\n13. Many injuries occur as a result of the mower being pulled over the foot during a fall caused by slipping or tripping. Do not hold onto the mower if you are falling; release the handle immediately.\n14. Never pull the mower back toward you while you are walking. If you must back the mower away from a wall or obstruction first look down and behind to avoid tripping and then follow these steps:\n    - Step back from mower to fully extend your arms.\n    - Be sure you are well balanced with sure footing.\n    - Pull the mower back slowly, no more than halfway toward you.\n    - Repeat these steps as needed.\n15. Do not operate the mower while under the influence of alcohol or drugs.\n16. Do not engage the self-propelled mechanism on machines so equipped while starting engine.\n17. The blade control is a safety device. Never attempt to bypass its operation. Doing so makes the safety device inoperative and may result in personal injury through contact with the rotating blade. The blade control must operate easily in both directions and automatically return to the disengaged position when released.\n18. Never operate the mower in wet grass. Always be sure of your footing. A slip and fall can cause serious personal injury. If you feel you are losing your footing, release the blade control handle immediately and the blade will stop rotating within three seconds.\n19. Mow only in daylight or good artificial light. Walk, never run.\n20. Stop the blade when crossing gravel drives, walks or roads.\n21. If the equipment should start to vibrate abnormally, stop the engine and check immediately for the cause. Vibration is generally a warning of trouble.\n22. Shut the engine off and wait until the blade comes to a complete stop before removing the grass catcher or unclogging the chute. The cutting blade continues to rotate for a few seconds after the blade control is released. Never place any part of the body in the blade area until you are sure the blade has stopped rotating.\n23. Never operate mower without proper trail shield, discharge cover, grass catcher, blade control or other safety protective devices in place and working. Never operate mower with damaged safety devices. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.\n24. Muffler and engine become hot and can cause a burn. Do not touch.\n25. Never attempt to make a wheel or cutting height adjustment while the engine is running.\n26. Only use parts and accessories made for this machine by the manufacturer. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.",
            "27. When starting engine, pull cord slowly until resistance is felt, then pull rapidly. Rapid retraction of starter cord (kickback) will pull hand and arm toward engine faster than you can let go. Broken bones, fractures, bruises or sprains could result.\n28. If situations occur which are not covered in this manual, use care and good judgment. Contact Customer Support for assistance and the name of your nearest servicing dealer.",
            "### Children\n\nTragic accidents can occur if the operator is not alert to the presence of children. Children are often attracted to the mower and the mowing activity. They do not understand the dangers. Never assume that children will remain where you last saw them.\n\n1. Keep children out of the mowing area and under watchful care of a responsible adult other than the operator.\n2. Be alert and turn mower off if a child enters the area.\n3. Before and while moving backwards, look behind and down for small children.\n4. Use extreme care when approaching blind corners, doorways, shrubs, trees, or other objects that may block your vision of a child who may run into the mower.\n5. Keep children away from hot or running engines. They can suffer burns from a hot muffler.\n6. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and be trained and supervised by an adult.\n\n### Service\n\nSafe Handling of Gasoline\n\nTo avoid personal injury or property damage, use extreme care in handling gasoline. Gasoline is extremely flammable and the vapors are explosive. Serious personal injury can occur when gasoline is spilled on yourself or your clothes, which can ignite. Wash your skin and change clothes immediately.\n\n1. Use only an approved gasoline container.\n2. Never fill containers inside a vehicle or on a truck or trailer bed with a plastic liner. Always place containers on the ground away from your vehicle before filling.\n3. Remove gas-powered equipment from the truck or trailer and refuel it on the ground. If this is not possible, then refuel such equipment on a trailer with a portable container, rather than from a gasoline dispenser nozzle.\n4. Keep the nozzle in contact with the rim of the fuel tank or container opening at all times until fueling is complete. Do not use a nozzle lock-open device.\n5. Extinguish all cigarettes, cigars, pipes and other sources of ignition.\n6. Never fuel machine indoors because flammable vapors will accumulate in the area.\n7. Never remove gas cap or add fuel while the engine is hot or running. Allow engine to cool at least two minutes before refueling.\n8. Never overfill fuel tank. Fill tank to no more than \u00bd inch below bottom of filler neck to provide space for fuel expansion.\n9. Replace gasoline cap and tighten securely.\n10. If gasoline is spilled, wipe it off the engine and equipment. Move machine to another area. Wait 5 minutes before starting engine.\n11. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light (e.g. furnace, water heater, space heater, clothes dryer, etc.).\n12. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n13. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light such as a water heater, furnace, clothes dryer etc.\n14. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n\n---\n\n## General Service\n\n1. Never run an engine indoors or in a poorly ventilated area. Engine exhaust contains carbon monoxide, an odorless and deadly gas.\n2. Before cleaning, repairing, or inspecting, make certain the blade and all moving parts have stopped. Disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine to prevent unintended starting.\n3. Check the blade and engine mounting bolts at frequent intervals for proper tightness. Also, visually inspect blade for damage (e.g., bent, cracked, worn). Replace blade with the original equipment manufacturer\u2019s (O.E.M.) blade only, listed in this manual. \u201cUse of parts which do not meet the original equipment specifications may lead to improper performance and compromise safety!\u201d\n4. Mower blades are sharp and can cut. Wrap the blade or wear gloves, and use extra caution when servicing them.\n5. Keep all nuts, bolts, and screws tight to be sure the equipment is in safe working condition.\n6. Never tamper with safety devices. Check their proper operation regularly.\n7. After striking a foreign object, stop the engine, disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine. Thoroughly inspect the mower for any damage. Repair the damage before starting and operating the mower.\n8. Never attempt to make adjustments or repairs to the mower while the engine is running.\n9. Grass catcher components are subject to wear, damage and deterioration, which could expose moving parts or allow objects to be thrown. Frequently check components and replace with the manufacturer\u2019s recommended parts when necessary.\n10. Mower blades are sharp and can cut.

            "### DANGER\n\nThis machine was built to be operated according to the safe operation practices in this manual. As with any type of power equipment, carelessness or error on the part of the operator can result in serious injury. This machine is capable of amputating fingers, hands, toes and feet and throwing objects. Failure to observe the following safety instructions could result in serious injury or death.\n\n### General Operation",
            "1. Read this operator's manual carefully in its entirety before attempting to assemble this machine. Read, understand, and follow all instructions on the machine and in the manual(s) before operation. Keep this manual in a safe place for future and regular reference and for ordering replacement parts.\n2. Be completely familiar with the controls and the proper use of this machine before operating it.\n3. This machine is a precision piece of power equipment, not a plaything. Therefore, exercise extreme caution at all times. This machine has been designed to perform one job: to mow grass. Do not use it for any other purpose.\n4. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and should be trained and supervised by an adult.\n5. Only responsible individuals who are familiar with these rules of safe operation should be allowed to use this machine.\n6. Thoroughly inspect the area where the equipment is to be used. Remove all stones, sticks, wire, bones, toys and other foreign objects, which could be tripped over or picked up and thrown by the blade. Thrown objects can cause serious personal injury.\n7. Plan your mowing pattern to avoid discharge of material toward roads, sidewalks, bystanders and the like. Also, avoid discharging material against a wall or obstruction, which may cause discharged material to ricochet back toward the operator.\n8. To help avoid blade contact or a thrown object injury, stay in operator zone behind handles and keep children, bystanders, helpers and pets at least 75 feet from mower while it is in operation. Stop machine if anyone enters area.\n9. Always wear safety glasses or safety goggles during operation and while performing an adjustment or repair to protect your eyes. Thrown objects which ricochet can cause serious injury to the eyes.\n10. Wear sturdy, rough-soled work shoes and close-fitting slacks and shirts. Shirts and pants that cover the arms and legs and steel-toed shoes are recommended. Never operate this machine in bare feet, sandals, slippery or lightweight (e.g., canvas) shoes.\n11. Do not put hands or feet near rotating parts or under the cutting deck. Contact with blade can amputate fingers, hands, toes and feet.\n12. A missing or damaged discharge cover can cause blade contact or thrown object injuries.\n13. Many injuries occur as a result of the mower being pulled over the foot during a fall caused by slipping or tripping. Do not hold onto the mower if you are falling; release the handle immediately.\n14. Never pull the mower back toward you while you are walking. If you must back the mower away from a wall or obstruction first look down and behind to avoid tripping and then follow these steps:\n    - Step back from mower to fully extend your arms.\n    - Be sure you are well balanced with sure footing.\n    - Pull the mower back slowly, no more than halfway toward you.\n    - Repeat these steps as needed.\n15. Do not operate the mower while under the influence of alcohol or drugs.\n16. Do not engage the self-propelled mechanism on machines so equipped while starting engine.\n17. The blade control is a safety device. Never attempt to bypass its operation. Doing so makes the safety device inoperative and may result in personal injury through contact with the rotating blade. The blade control must operate easily in both directions and automatically return to the disengaged position when released.\n18. Never operate the mower in wet grass. Always be sure of your footing. A slip and fall can cause serious personal injury. If you feel you are losing your footing, release the blade control handle immediately and the blade will stop rotating within three seconds.\n19. Mow only in daylight or good artificial light. Walk, never run.\n20. Stop the blade when crossing gravel drives, walks or roads.\n21. If the equipment should start to vibrate abnormally, stop the engine and check immediately for the cause. Vibration is generally a warning of trouble.\n22. Shut the engine off and wait until the blade comes to a complete stop before removing the grass catcher or unclogging the chute. The cutting blade continues to rotate for a few seconds after the blade control is released. Never place any part of the body in the blade area until you are sure the blade has stopped rotating.\n23. Never operate mower without proper trail shield, discharge cover, grass catcher, blade control or other safety protective devices in place and working. Never operate mower with damaged safety devices. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.\n24. Muffler and engine become hot and can cause a burn. Do not touch.\n25. Never attempt to make a wheel or cutting height adjustment while the engine is running.\n26. Only use parts and accessories made for this machine by the manufacturer. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.",
            "27. When starting engine, pull cord slowly until resistance is felt, then pull rapidly. Rapid retraction of starter cord (kickback) will pull hand and arm toward engine faster than you can let go. Broken bones, fractures, bruises or sprains could result.\n28. If situations occur which are not covered in this manual, use care and good judgment. Contact Customer Support for assistance and the name of your nearest servicing dealer.",
            "### Children\n\nTragic accidents can occur if the operator is not alert to the presence of children. Children are often attracted to the mower and the mowing activity. They do not understand the dangers. Never assume that children will remain where you last saw them.\n\n1. Keep children out of the mowing area and under watchful care of a responsible adult other than the operator.\n2. Be alert and turn mower off if a child enters the area.\n3. Before and while moving backwards, look behind and down for small children.\n4. Use extreme care when approaching blind corners, doorways, shrubs, trees, or other objects that may block your vision of a child who may run into the mower.\n5. Keep children away from hot or running engines. They can suffer burns from a hot muffler.\n6. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and be trained and supervised by an adult.\n\n### Service\n\nSafe Handling of Gasoline\n\nTo avoid personal injury or property damage, use extreme care in handling gasoline. Gasoline is extremely flammable and the vapors are explosive. Serious personal injury can occur when gasoline is spilled on yourself or your clothes, which can ignite. Wash your skin and change clothes immediately.\n\n1. Use only an approved gasoline container.\n2. Never fill containers inside a vehicle or on a truck or trailer bed with a plastic liner. Always place containers on the ground away from your vehicle before filling.\n3. Remove gas-powered equipment from the truck or trailer and refuel it on the ground. If this is not possible, then refuel such equipment on a trailer with a portable container, rather than from a gasoline dispenser nozzle.\n4. Keep the nozzle in contact with the rim of the fuel tank or container opening at all times until fueling is complete. Do not use a nozzle lock-open device.\n5. Extinguish all cigarettes, cigars, pipes and other sources of ignition.\n6. Never fuel machine indoors because flammable vapors will accumulate in the area.\n7. Never remove gas cap or add fuel while the engine is hot or running. Allow engine to cool at least two minutes before refueling.\n8. Never overfill fuel tank. Fill tank to no more than \u00bd inch below bottom of filler neck to provide space for fuel expansion.\n9. Replace gasoline cap and tighten securely.\n10. If gasoline is spilled, wipe it off the engine and equipment. Move machine to another area. Wait 5 minutes before starting engine.\n11. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light (e.g. furnace, water heater, space heater, clothes dryer, etc.).\n12. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n13. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light such as a water heater, furnace, clothes dryer etc.\n14. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n\n---\n\n## General Service\n\n1. Never run an engine indoors or in a poorly ventilated area. Engine exhaust contains carbon monoxide, an odorless and deadly gas.\n2. Before cleaning, repairing, or inspecting, make certain the blade and all moving parts have stopped. Disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine to prevent unintended starting.\n3. Check the blade and engine mounting bolts at frequent intervals for proper tightness. Also, visually inspect blade for damage (e.g., bent, cracked, worn). Replace blade with the original equipment manufacturer\u2019s (O.E.M.) blade only, listed in this manual. \u201cUse of parts which do not meet the original equipment specifications may lead to improper performance and compromise safety!\u201d\n4. Mower blades are sharp and can cut. Wrap the blade or wear gloves, and use extra caution when servicing them.\n5. Keep all nuts, bolts, and screws tight to be sure the equipment is in safe working condition.\n6. Never tamper with safety devices. Check their proper operation regularly.\n7. After striking a foreign object, stop the engine, disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine. Thoroughly inspect the mower for any damage. Repair the damage before starting and operating the mower.\n8. Never attempt to make adjustments or repairs to the mower while the engine is running.\n9. Grass catcher components are subject to wear, damage and deterioration, which could expose moving parts or allow objects to be thrown. Frequently check components and replace with the manufacturer\u2019s recommended parts when necessary.\n10. Mower blades are sharp and can cut.

            "### DANGER\n\nThis machine was built to be operated according to the safe operation practices in this manual. As with any type of power equipment, carelessness or error on the part of the operator can result in serious injury. This machine is capable of amputating fingers, hands, toes and feet and throwing objects. Failure to observe the following safety instructions could result in serious injury or death.\n\n### General Operation",
            "1. Read this operator's manual carefully in its entirety before attempting to assemble this machine. Read, understand, and follow all instructions on the machine and in the manual(s) before operation. Keep this manual in a safe place for future and regular reference and for ordering replacement parts.\n2. Be completely familiar with the controls and the proper use of this machine before operating it.\n3. This machine is a precision piece of power equipment, not a plaything. Therefore, exercise extreme caution at all times. This machine has been designed to perform one job: to mow grass. Do not use it for any other purpose.\n4. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and should be trained and supervised by an adult.\n5. Only responsible individuals who are familiar with these rules of safe operation should be allowed to use this machine.\n6. Thoroughly inspect the area where the equipment is to be used. Remove all stones, sticks, wire, bones, toys and other foreign objects, which could be tripped over or picked up and thrown by the blade. Thrown objects can cause serious personal injury.\n7. Plan your mowing pattern to avoid discharge of material toward roads, sidewalks, bystanders and the like. Also, avoid discharging material against a wall or obstruction, which may cause discharged material to ricochet back toward the operator.\n8. To help avoid blade contact or a thrown object injury, stay in operator zone behind handles and keep children, bystanders, helpers and pets at least 75 feet from mower while it is in operation. Stop machine if anyone enters area.\n9. Always wear safety glasses or safety goggles during operation and while performing an adjustment or repair to protect your eyes. Thrown objects which ricochet can cause serious injury to the eyes.\n10. Wear sturdy, rough-soled work shoes and close-fitting slacks and shirts. Shirts and pants that cover the arms and legs and steel-toed shoes are recommended. Never operate this machine in bare feet, sandals, slippery or lightweight (e.g., canvas) shoes.\n11. Do not put hands or feet near rotating parts or under the cutting deck. Contact with blade can amputate fingers, hands, toes and feet.\n12. A missing or damaged discharge cover can cause blade contact or thrown object injuries.\n13. Many injuries occur as a result of the mower being pulled over the foot during a fall caused by slipping or tripping. Do not hold onto the mower if you are falling; release the handle immediately.\n14. Never pull the mower back toward you while you are walking. If you must back the mower away from a wall or obstruction first look down and behind to avoid tripping and then follow these steps:\n    - Step back from mower to fully extend your arms.\n    - Be sure you are well balanced with sure footing.\n    - Pull the mower back slowly, no more than halfway toward you.\n    - Repeat these steps as needed.\n15. Do not operate the mower while under the influence of alcohol or drugs.\n16. Do not engage the self-propelled mechanism on machines so equipped while starting engine.\n17. The blade control is a safety device. Never attempt to bypass its operation. Doing so makes the safety device inoperative and may result in personal injury through contact with the rotating blade. The blade control must operate easily in both directions and automatically return to the disengaged position when released.\n18. Never operate the mower in wet grass. Always be sure of your footing. A slip and fall can cause serious personal injury. If you feel you are losing your footing, release the blade control handle immediately and the blade will stop rotating within three seconds.\n19. Mow only in daylight or good artificial light. Walk, never run.\n20. Stop the blade when crossing gravel drives, walks or roads.\n21. If the equipment should start to vibrate abnormally, stop the engine and check immediately for the cause. Vibration is generally a warning of trouble.\n22. Shut the engine off and wait until the blade comes to a complete stop before removing the grass catcher or unclogging the chute. The cutting blade continues to rotate for a few seconds after the blade control is released. Never place any part of the body in the blade area until you are sure the blade has stopped rotating.\n23. Never operate mower without proper trail shield, discharge cover, grass catcher, blade control or other safety protective devices in place and working. Never operate mower with damaged safety devices. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.\n24. Muffler and engine become hot and can cause a burn. Do not touch.\n25. Never attempt to make a wheel or cutting height adjustment while the engine is running.\n26. Only use parts and accessories made for this machine by the manufacturer. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.",
            "27. When starting engine, pull cord slowly until resistance is felt, then pull rapidly. Rapid retraction of starter cord (kickback) will pull hand and arm toward engine faster than you can let go. Broken bones, fractures, bruises or sprains could result.\n28. If situations occur which are not covered in this manual, use care and good judgment. Contact Customer Support for assistance and the name of your nearest servicing dealer.",
            "### Children\n\nTragic accidents can occur if the operator is not alert to the presence of children. Children are often attracted to the mower and the mowing activity. They do not understand the dangers. Never assume that children will remain where you last saw them.\n\n1. Keep children out of the mowing area and under watchful care of a responsible adult other than the operator.\n2. Be alert and turn mower off if a child enters the area.\n3. Before and while moving backwards, look behind and down for small children.\n4. Use extreme care when approaching blind corners, doorways, shrubs, trees, or other objects that may block your vision of a child who may run into the mower.\n5. Keep children away from hot or running engines. They can suffer burns from a hot muffler.\n6. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and be trained and supervised by an adult.\n\n### Service\n\nSafe Handling of Gasoline\n\nTo avoid personal injury or property damage, use extreme care in handling gasoline. Gasoline is extremely flammable and the vapors are explosive. Serious personal injury can occur when gasoline is spilled on yourself or your clothes, which can ignite. Wash your skin and change clothes immediately.\n\n1. Use only an approved gasoline container.\n2. Never fill containers inside a vehicle or on a truck or trailer bed with a plastic liner. Always place containers on the ground away from your vehicle before filling.\n3. Remove gas-powered equipment from the truck or trailer and refuel it on the ground. If this is not possible, then refuel such equipment on a trailer with a portable container, rather than from a gasoline dispenser nozzle.\n4. Keep the nozzle in contact with the rim of the fuel tank or container opening at all times until fueling is complete. Do not use a nozzle lock-open device.\n5. Extinguish all cigarettes, cigars, pipes and other sources of ignition.\n6. Never fuel machine indoors because flammable vapors will accumulate in the area.\n7. Never remove gas cap or add fuel while the engine is hot or running. Allow engine to cool at least two minutes before refueling.\n8. Never overfill fuel tank. Fill tank to no more than \u00bd inch below bottom of filler neck to provide space for fuel expansion.\n9. Replace gasoline cap and tighten securely.\n10. If gasoline is spilled, wipe it off the engine and equipment. Move machine to another area. Wait 5 minutes before starting engine.\n11. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light (e.g. furnace, water heater, space heater, clothes dryer, etc.).\n12. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n13. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light such as a water heater, furnace, clothes dryer etc.\n14. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n\n---\n\n## General Service\n\n1. Never run an engine indoors or in a poorly ventilated area. Engine exhaust contains carbon monoxide, an odorless and deadly gas.\n2. Before cleaning, repairing, or inspecting, make certain the blade and all moving parts have stopped. Disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine to prevent unintended starting.\n3. Check the blade and engine mounting bolts at frequent intervals for proper tightness. Also, visually inspect blade for damage (e.g., bent, cracked, worn). Replace blade with the original equipment manufacturer\u2019s (O.E.M.) blade only, listed in this manual. \u201cUse of parts which do not meet the original equipment specifications may lead to improper performance and compromise safety!\u201d\n4. Mower blades are sharp and can cut. Wrap the blade or wear gloves, and use extra caution when servicing them.\n5. Keep all nuts, bolts, and screws tight to be sure the equipment is in safe working condition.\n6. Never tamper with safety devices. Check their proper operation regularly.\n7. After striking a foreign object, stop the engine, disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine. Thoroughly inspect the mower for any damage. Repair the damage before starting and operating the mower.\n8. Never attempt to make adjustments or repairs to the mower while the engine is running.\n9. Grass catcher components are subject to wear, damage and deterioration, which could expose moving parts or allow objects to be thrown. Frequently check components and replace with the manufacturer\u2019s recommended parts when necessary.\n10. Mower blades are sharp and can cut.

            "### DANGER\n\nThis machine was built to be operated according to the safe operation practices in this manual. As with any type of power equipment, carelessness or error on the part of the operator can result in serious injury. This machine is capable of amputating fingers, hands, toes and feet and throwing objects. Failure to observe the following safety instructions could result in serious injury or death.\n\n### General Operation",
            "1. Read this operator's manual carefully in its entirety before attempting to assemble this machine. Read, understand, and follow all instructions on the machine and in the manual(s) before operation. Keep this manual in a safe place for future and regular reference and for ordering replacement parts.\n2. Be completely familiar with the controls and the proper use of this machine before operating it.\n3. This machine is a precision piece of power equipment, not a plaything. Therefore, exercise extreme caution at all times. This machine has been designed to perform one job: to mow grass. Do not use it for any other purpose.\n4. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and should be trained and supervised by an adult.\n5. Only responsible individuals who are familiar with these rules of safe operation should be allowed to use this machine.\n6. Thoroughly inspect the area where the equipment is to be used. Remove all stones, sticks, wire, bones, toys and other foreign objects, which could be tripped over or picked up and thrown by the blade. Thrown objects can cause serious personal injury.\n7. Plan your mowing pattern to avoid discharge of material toward roads, sidewalks, bystanders and the like. Also, avoid discharging material against a wall or obstruction, which may cause discharged material to ricochet back toward the operator.\n8. To help avoid blade contact or a thrown object injury, stay in operator zone behind handles and keep children, bystanders, helpers and pets at least 75 feet from mower while it is in operation. Stop machine if anyone enters area.\n9. Always wear safety glasses or safety goggles during operation and while performing an adjustment or repair to protect your eyes. Thrown objects which ricochet can cause serious injury to the eyes.\n10. Wear sturdy, rough-soled work shoes and close-fitting slacks and shirts. Shirts and pants that cover the arms and legs and steel-toed shoes are recommended. Never operate this machine in bare feet, sandals, slippery or lightweight (e.g., canvas) shoes.\n11. Do not put hands or feet near rotating parts or under the cutting deck. Contact with blade can amputate fingers, hands, toes and feet.\n12. A missing or damaged discharge cover can cause blade contact or thrown object injuries.\n13. Many injuries occur as a result of the mower being pulled over the foot during a fall caused by slipping or tripping. Do not hold onto the mower if you are falling; release the handle immediately.\n14. Never pull the mower back toward you while you are walking. If you must back the mower away from a wall or obstruction first look down and behind to avoid tripping and then follow these steps:\n    - Step back from mower to fully extend your arms.\n    - Be sure you are well balanced with sure footing.\n    - Pull the mower back slowly, no more than halfway toward you.\n    - Repeat these steps as needed.\n15. Do not operate the mower while under the influence of alcohol or drugs.\n16. Do not engage the self-propelled mechanism on machines so equipped while starting engine.\n17. The blade control is a safety device. Never attempt to bypass its operation. Doing so makes the safety device inoperative and may result in personal injury through contact with the rotating blade. The blade control must operate easily in both directions and automatically return to the disengaged position when released.\n18. Never operate the mower in wet grass. Always be sure of your footing. A slip and fall can cause serious personal injury. If you feel you are losing your footing, release the blade control handle immediately and the blade will stop rotating within three seconds.\n19. Mow only in daylight or good artificial light. Walk, never run.\n20. Stop the blade when crossing gravel drives, walks or roads.\n21. If the equipment should start to vibrate abnormally, stop the engine and check immediately for the cause. Vibration is generally a warning of trouble.\n22. Shut the engine off and wait until the blade comes to a complete stop before removing the grass catcher or unclogging the chute. The cutting blade continues to rotate for a few seconds after the blade control is released. Never place any part of the body in the blade area until you are sure the blade has stopped rotating.\n23. Never operate mower without proper trail shield, discharge cover, grass catcher, blade control or other safety protective devices in place and working. Never operate mower with damaged safety devices. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.\n24. Muffler and engine become hot and can cause a burn. Do not touch.\n25. Never attempt to make a wheel or cutting height adjustment while the engine is running.\n26. Only use parts and accessories made for this machine by the manufacturer. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.",
            "27. When starting engine, pull cord slowly until resistance is felt, then pull rapidly. Rapid retraction of starter cord (kickback) will pull hand and arm toward engine faster than you can let go. Broken bones, fractures, bruises or sprains could result.\n28. If situations occur which are not covered in this manual, use care and good judgment. Contact Customer Support for assistance and the name of your nearest servicing dealer.",
            "### Children\n\nTragic accidents can occur if the operator is not alert to the presence of children. Children are often attracted to the mower and the mowing activity. They do not understand the dangers. Never assume that children will remain where you last saw them.\n\n1. Keep children out of the mowing area and under watchful care of a responsible adult other than the operator.\n2. Be alert and turn mower off if a child enters the area.\n3. Before and while moving backwards, look behind and down for small children.\n4. Use extreme care when approaching blind corners, doorways, shrubs, trees, or other objects that may block your vision of a child who may run into the mower.\n5. Keep children away from hot or running engines. They can suffer burns from a hot muffler.\n6. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and be trained and supervised by an adult.\n\n### Service\n\nSafe Handling of Gasoline\n\nTo avoid personal injury or property damage, use extreme care in handling gasoline. Gasoline is extremely flammable and the vapors are explosive. Serious personal injury can occur when gasoline is spilled on yourself or your clothes, which can ignite. Wash your skin and change clothes immediately.\n\n1. Use only an approved gasoline container.\n2. Never fill containers inside a vehicle or on a truck or trailer bed with a plastic liner. Always place containers on the ground away from your vehicle before filling.\n3. Remove gas-powered equipment from the truck or trailer and refuel it on the ground. If this is not possible, then refuel such equipment on a trailer with a portable container, rather than from a gasoline dispenser nozzle.\n4. Keep the nozzle in contact with the rim of the fuel tank or container opening at all times until fueling is complete. Do not use a nozzle lock-open device.\n5. Extinguish all cigarettes, cigars, pipes and other sources of ignition.\n6. Never fuel machine indoors because flammable vapors will accumulate in the area.\n7. Never remove gas cap or add fuel while the engine is hot or running. Allow engine to cool at least two minutes before refueling.\n8. Never overfill fuel tank. Fill tank to no more than \u00bd inch below bottom of filler neck to provide space for fuel expansion.\n9. Replace gasoline cap and tighten securely.\n10. If gasoline is spilled, wipe it off the engine and equipment. Move machine to another area. Wait 5 minutes before starting engine.\n11. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light (e.g. furnace, water heater, space heater, clothes dryer, etc.).\n12. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n13. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light such as a water heater, furnace, clothes dryer etc.\n14. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n\n---\n\n## General Service\n\n1. Never run an engine indoors or in a poorly ventilated area. Engine exhaust contains carbon monoxide, an odorless and deadly gas.\n2. Before cleaning, repairing, or inspecting, make certain the blade and all moving parts have stopped. Disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine to prevent unintended starting.\n3. Check the blade and engine mounting bolts at frequent intervals for proper tightness. Also, visually inspect blade for damage (e.g., bent, cracked, worn). Replace blade with the original equipment manufacturer\u2019s (O.E.M.) blade only, listed in this manual. \u201cUse of parts which do not meet the original equipment specifications may lead to improper performance and compromise safety!\u201d\n4. Mower blades are sharp and can cut. Wrap the blade or wear gloves, and use extra caution when servicing them.\n5. Keep all nuts, bolts, and screws tight to be sure the equipment is in safe working condition.\n6. Never tamper with safety devices. Check their proper operation regularly.\n7. After striking a foreign object, stop the engine, disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine. Thoroughly inspect the mower for any damage. Repair the damage before starting and operating the mower.\n8. Never attempt to make adjustments or repairs to the mower while the engine is running.\n9. Grass catcher components are subject to wear, damage and deterioration, which could expose moving parts or allow objects to be thrown. Frequently check components and replace with the manufacturer\u2019s recommended parts when necessary.\n10. Mower blades are sharp and can cut.

            "### DANGER\n\nThis machine was built to be operated according to the safe operation practices in this manual. As with any type of power equipment, carelessness or error on the part of the operator can result in serious injury. This machine is capable of amputating fingers, hands, toes and feet and throwing objects. Failure to observe the following safety instructions could result in serious injury or death.\n\n### General Operation",
            "1. Read this operator's manual carefully in its entirety before attempting to assemble this machine. Read, understand, and follow all instructions on the machine and in the manual(s) before operation. Keep this manual in a safe place for future and regular reference and for ordering replacement parts.\n2. Be completely familiar with the controls and the proper use of this machine before operating it.\n3. This machine is a precision piece of power equipment, not a plaything. Therefore, exercise extreme caution at all times. This machine has been designed to perform one job: to mow grass. Do not use it for any other purpose.\n4. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and should be trained and supervised by an adult.\n5. Only responsible individuals who are familiar with these rules of safe operation should be allowed to use this machine.\n6. Thoroughly inspect the area where the equipment is to be used. Remove all stones, sticks, wire, bones, toys and other foreign objects, which could be tripped over or picked up and thrown by the blade. Thrown objects can cause serious personal injury.\n7. Plan your mowing pattern to avoid discharge of material toward roads, sidewalks, bystanders and the like. Also, avoid discharging material against a wall or obstruction, which may cause discharged material to ricochet back toward the operator.\n8. To help avoid blade contact or a thrown object injury, stay in operator zone behind handles and keep children, bystanders, helpers and pets at least 75 feet from mower while it is in operation. Stop machine if anyone enters area.\n9. Always wear safety glasses or safety goggles during operation and while performing an adjustment or repair to protect your eyes. Thrown objects which ricochet can cause serious injury to the eyes.\n10. Wear sturdy, rough-soled work shoes and close-fitting slacks and shirts. Shirts and pants that cover the arms and legs and steel-toed shoes are recommended. Never operate this machine in bare feet, sandals, slippery or lightweight (e.g., canvas) shoes.\n11. Do not put hands or feet near rotating parts or under the cutting deck. Contact with blade can amputate fingers, hands, toes and feet.\n12. A missing or damaged discharge cover can cause blade contact or thrown object injuries.\n13. Many injuries occur as a result of the mower being pulled over the foot during a fall caused by slipping or tripping. Do not hold onto the mower if you are falling; release the handle immediately.\n14. Never pull the mower back toward you while you are walking. If you must back the mower away from a wall or obstruction first look down and behind to avoid tripping and then follow these steps:\n    - Step back from mower to fully extend your arms.\n    - Be sure you are well balanced with sure footing.\n    - Pull the mower back slowly, no more than halfway toward you.\n    - Repeat these steps as needed.\n15. Do not operate the mower while under the influence of alcohol or drugs.\n16. Do not engage the self-propelled mechanism on machines so equipped while starting engine.\n17. The blade control is a safety device. Never attempt to bypass its operation. Doing so makes the safety device inoperative and may result in personal injury through contact with the rotating blade. The blade control must operate easily in both directions and automatically return to the disengaged position when released.\n18. Never operate the mower in wet grass. Always be sure of your footing. A slip and fall can cause serious personal injury. If you feel you are losing your footing, release the blade control handle immediately and the blade will stop rotating within three seconds.\n19. Mow only in daylight or good artificial light. Walk, never run.\n20. Stop the blade when crossing gravel drives, walks or roads.\n21. If the equipment should start to vibrate abnormally, stop the engine and check immediately for the cause. Vibration is generally a warning of trouble.\n22. Shut the engine off and wait until the blade comes to a complete stop before removing the grass catcher or unclogging the chute. The cutting blade continues to rotate for a few seconds after the blade control is released. Never place any part of the body in the blade area until you are sure the blade has stopped rotating.\n23. Never operate mower without proper trail shield, discharge cover, grass catcher, blade control or other safety protective devices in place and working. Never operate mower with damaged safety devices. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.\n24. Muffler and engine become hot and can cause a burn. Do not touch.\n25. Never attempt to make a wheel or cutting height adjustment while the engine is running.\n26. Only use parts and accessories made for this machine by the manufacturer. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.",
            "27. When starting engine, pull cord slowly until resistance is felt, then pull rapidly. Rapid retraction of starter cord (kickback) will pull hand and arm toward engine faster than you can let go. Broken bones, fractures, bruises or sprains could result.\n28. If situations occur which are not covered in this manual, use care and good judgment. Contact Customer Support for assistance and the name of your nearest servicing dealer.",
            "### Children\n\nTragic accidents can occur if the operator is not alert to the presence of children. Children are often attracted to the mower and the mowing activity. They do not understand the dangers. Never assume that children will remain where you last saw them.\n\n1. Keep children out of the mowing area and under watchful care of a responsible adult other than the operator.\n2. Be alert and turn mower off if a child enters the area.\n3. Before and while moving backwards, look behind and down for small children.\n4. Use extreme care when approaching blind corners, doorways, shrubs, trees, or other objects that may block your vision of a child who may run into the mower.\n5. Keep children away from hot or running engines. They can suffer burns from a hot muffler.\n6. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and be trained and supervised by an adult.\n\n### Service\n\nSafe Handling of Gasoline\n\nTo avoid personal injury or property damage, use extreme care in handling gasoline. Gasoline is extremely flammable and the vapors are explosive. Serious personal injury can occur when gasoline is spilled on yourself or your clothes, which can ignite. Wash your skin and change clothes immediately.\n\n1. Use only an approved gasoline container.\n2. Never fill containers inside a vehicle or on a truck or trailer bed with a plastic liner. Always place containers on the ground away from your vehicle before filling.\n3. Remove gas-powered equipment from the truck or trailer and refuel it on the ground. If this is not possible, then refuel such equipment on a trailer with a portable container, rather than from a gasoline dispenser nozzle.\n4. Keep the nozzle in contact with the rim of the fuel tank or container opening at all times until fueling is complete. Do not use a nozzle lock-open device.\n5. Extinguish all cigarettes, cigars, pipes and other sources of ignition.\n6. Never fuel machine indoors because flammable vapors will accumulate in the area.\n7. Never remove gas cap or add fuel while the engine is hot or running. Allow engine to cool at least two minutes before refueling.\n8. Never overfill fuel tank. Fill tank to no more than \u00bd inch below bottom of filler neck to provide space for fuel expansion.\n9. Replace gasoline cap and tighten securely.\n10. If gasoline is spilled, wipe it off the engine and equipment. Move machine to another area. Wait 5 minutes before starting engine.\n11. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light (e.g. furnace, water heater, space heater, clothes dryer, etc.).\n12. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n13. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light such as a water heater, furnace, clothes dryer etc.\n14. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n\n---\n\n## General Service\n\n1. Never run an engine indoors or in a poorly ventilated area. Engine exhaust contains carbon monoxide, an odorless and deadly gas.\n2. Before cleaning, repairing, or inspecting, make certain the blade and all moving parts have stopped. Disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine to prevent unintended starting.\n3. Check the blade and engine mounting bolts at frequent intervals for proper tightness. Also, visually inspect blade for damage (e.g., bent, cracked, worn). Replace blade with the original equipment manufacturer\u2019s (O.E.M.) blade only, listed in this manual. \u201cUse of parts which do not meet the original equipment specifications may lead to improper performance and compromise safety!\u201d\n4. Mower blades are sharp and can cut. Wrap the blade or wear gloves, and use extra caution when servicing them.\n5. Keep all nuts, bolts, and screws tight to be sure the equipment is in safe working condition.\n6. Never tamper with safety devices. Check their proper operation regularly.\n7. After striking a foreign object, stop the engine, disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine. Thoroughly inspect the mower for any damage. Repair the damage before starting and operating the mower.\n8. Never attempt to make adjustments or repairs to the mower while the engine is running.\n9. Grass catcher components are subject to wear, damage and deterioration, which could expose moving parts or allow objects to be thrown. Frequently check components and replace with the manufacturer\u2019s recommended parts when necessary.\n10. Mower blades are sharp and can cut.

            "### DANGER\n\nThis machine was built to be operated according to the safe operation practices in this manual. As with any type of power equipment, carelessness or error on the part of the operator can result in serious injury. This machine is capable of amputating fingers, hands, toes and feet and throwing objects. Failure to observe the following safety instructions could result in serious injury or death.\n\n### General Operation",
            "1. Read this operator's manual carefully in its entirety before attempting to assemble this machine. Read, understand, and follow all instructions on the machine and in the manual(s) before operation. Keep this manual in a safe place for future and regular reference and for ordering replacement parts.\n2. Be completely familiar with the controls and the proper use of this machine before operating it.\n3. This machine is a precision piece of power equipment, not a plaything. Therefore, exercise extreme caution at all times. This machine has been designed to perform one job: to mow grass. Do not use it for any other purpose.\n4. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and should be trained and supervised by an adult.\n5. Only responsible individuals who are familiar with these rules of safe operation should be allowed to use this machine.\n6. Thoroughly inspect the area where the equipment is to be used. Remove all stones, sticks, wire, bones, toys and other foreign objects, which could be tripped over or picked up and thrown by the blade. Thrown objects can cause serious personal injury.\n7. Plan your mowing pattern to avoid discharge of material toward roads, sidewalks, bystanders and the like. Also, avoid discharging material against a wall or obstruction, which may cause discharged material to ricochet back toward the operator.\n8. To help avoid blade contact or a thrown object injury, stay in operator zone behind handles and keep children, bystanders, helpers and pets at least 75 feet from mower while it is in operation. Stop machine if anyone enters area.\n9. Always wear safety glasses or safety goggles during operation and while performing an adjustment or repair to protect your eyes. Thrown objects which ricochet can cause serious injury to the eyes.\n10. Wear sturdy, rough-soled work shoes and close-fitting slacks and shirts. Shirts and pants that cover the arms and legs and steel-toed shoes are recommended. Never operate this machine in bare feet, sandals, slippery or lightweight (e.g., canvas) shoes.\n11. Do not put hands or feet near rotating parts or under the cutting deck. Contact with blade can amputate fingers, hands, toes and feet.\n12. A missing or damaged discharge cover can cause blade contact or thrown object injuries.\n13. Many injuries occur as a result of the mower being pulled over the foot during a fall caused by slipping or tripping. Do not hold onto the mower if you are falling; release the handle immediately.\n14. Never pull the mower back toward you while you are walking. If you must back the mower away from a wall or obstruction first look down and behind to avoid tripping and then follow these steps:\n    - Step back from mower to fully extend your arms.\n    - Be sure you are well balanced with sure footing.\n    - Pull the mower back slowly, no more than halfway toward you.\n    - Repeat these steps as needed.\n15. Do not operate the mower while under the influence of alcohol or drugs.\n16. Do not engage the self-propelled mechanism on machines so equipped while starting engine.\n17. The blade control is a safety device. Never attempt to bypass its operation. Doing so makes the safety device inoperative and may result in personal injury through contact with the rotating blade. The blade control must operate easily in both directions and automatically return to the disengaged position when released.\n18. Never operate the mower in wet grass. Always be sure of your footing. A slip and fall can cause serious personal injury. If you feel you are losing your footing, release the blade control handle immediately and the blade will stop rotating within three seconds.\n19. Mow only in daylight or good artificial light. Walk, never run.\n20. Stop the blade when crossing gravel drives, walks or roads.\n21. If the equipment should start to vibrate abnormally, stop the engine and check immediately for the cause. Vibration is generally a warning of trouble.\n22. Shut the engine off and wait until the blade comes to a complete stop before removing the grass catcher or unclogging the chute. The cutting blade continues to rotate for a few seconds after the blade control is released. Never place any part of the body in the blade area until you are sure the blade has stopped rotating.\n23. Never operate mower without proper trail shield, discharge cover, grass catcher, blade control or other safety protective devices in place and working. Never operate mower with damaged safety devices. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.\n24. Muffler and engine become hot and can cause a burn. Do not touch.\n25. Never attempt to make a wheel or cutting height adjustment while the engine is running.\n26. Only use parts and accessories made for this machine by the manufacturer. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.",
            "27. When starting engine, pull cord slowly until resistance is felt, then pull rapidly. Rapid retraction of starter cord (kickback) will pull hand and arm toward engine faster than you can let go. Broken bones, fractures, bruises or sprains could result.\n28. If situations occur which are not covered in this manual, use care and good judgment. Contact Customer Support for assistance and the name of your nearest servicing dealer.",
            "### Children\n\nTragic accidents can occur if the operator is not alert to the presence of children. Children are often attracted to the mower and the mowing activity. They do not understand the dangers. Never assume that children will remain where you last saw them.\n\n1. Keep children out of the mowing area and under watchful care of a responsible adult other than the operator.\n2. Be alert and turn mower off if a child enters the area.\n3. Before and while moving backwards, look behind and down for small children.\n4. Use extreme care when approaching blind corners, doorways, shrubs, trees, or other objects that may block your vision of a child who may run into the mower.\n5. Keep children away from hot or running engines. They can suffer burns from a hot muffler.\n6. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and be trained and supervised by an adult.\n\n### Service\n\nSafe Handling of Gasoline\n\nTo avoid personal injury or property damage, use extreme care in handling gasoline. Gasoline is extremely flammable and the vapors are explosive. Serious personal injury can occur when gasoline is spilled on yourself or your clothes, which can ignite. Wash your skin and change clothes immediately.\n\n1. Use only an approved gasoline container.\n2. Never fill containers inside a vehicle or on a truck or trailer bed with a plastic liner. Always place containers on the ground away from your vehicle before filling.\n3. Remove gas-powered equipment from the truck or trailer and refuel it on the ground. If this is not possible, then refuel such equipment on a trailer with a portable container, rather than from a gasoline dispenser nozzle.\n4. Keep the nozzle in contact with the rim of the fuel tank or container opening at all times until fueling is complete. Do not use a nozzle lock-open device.\n5. Extinguish all cigarettes, cigars, pipes and other sources of ignition.\n6. Never fuel machine indoors because flammable vapors will accumulate in the area.\n7. Never remove gas cap or add fuel while the engine is hot or running. Allow engine to cool at least two minutes before refueling.\n8. Never overfill fuel tank. Fill tank to no more than \u00bd inch below bottom of filler neck to provide space for fuel expansion.\n9. Replace gasoline cap and tighten securely.\n10. If gasoline is spilled, wipe it off the engine and equipment. Move machine to another area. Wait 5 minutes before starting engine.\n11. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light (e.g. furnace, water heater, space heater, clothes dryer, etc.).\n12. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n13. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light such as a water heater, furnace, clothes dryer etc.\n14. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n\n---\n\n## General Service\n\n1. Never run an engine indoors or in a poorly ventilated area. Engine exhaust contains carbon monoxide, an odorless and deadly gas.\n2. Before cleaning, repairing, or inspecting, make certain the blade and all moving parts have stopped. Disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine to prevent unintended starting.\n3. Check the blade and engine mounting bolts at frequent intervals for proper tightness. Also, visually inspect blade for damage (e.g., bent, cracked, worn). Replace blade with the original equipment manufacturer\u2019s (O.E.M.) blade only, listed in this manual. \u201cUse of parts which do not meet the original equipment specifications may lead to improper performance and compromise safety!\u201d\n4. Mower blades are sharp and can cut. Wrap the blade or wear gloves, and use extra caution when servicing them.\n5. Keep all nuts, bolts, and screws tight to be sure the equipment is in safe working condition.\n6. Never tamper with safety devices. Check their proper operation regularly.\n7. After striking a foreign object, stop the engine, disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine. Thoroughly inspect the mower for any damage. Repair the damage before starting and operating the mower.\n8. Never attempt to make adjustments or repairs to the mower while the engine is running.\n9. Grass catcher components are subject to wear, damage and deterioration, which could expose moving parts or allow objects to be thrown. Frequently check components and replace with the manufacturer\u2019s recommended parts when necessary.\n10. Mower blades are sharp and can cut.

            "### DANGER\n\nThis machine was built to be operated according to the safe operation practices in this manual. As with any type of power equipment, carelessness or error on the part of the operator can result in serious injury. This machine is capable of amputating fingers, hands, toes and feet and throwing objects. Failure to observe the following safety instructions could result in serious injury or death.\n\n### General Operation",
            "1. Read this operator's manual carefully in its entirety before attempting to assemble this machine. Read, understand, and follow all instructions on the machine and in the manual(s) before operation. Keep this manual in a safe place for future and regular reference and for ordering replacement parts.\n2. Be completely familiar with the controls and the proper use of this machine before operating it.\n3. This machine is a precision piece of power equipment, not a plaything. Therefore, exercise extreme caution at all times. This machine has been designed to perform one job: to mow grass. Do not use it for any other purpose.\n4. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and should be trained and supervised by an adult.\n5. Only responsible individuals who are familiar with these rules of safe operation should be allowed to use this machine.\n6. Thoroughly inspect the area where the equipment is to be used. Remove all stones, sticks, wire, bones, toys and other foreign objects, which could be tripped over or picked up and thrown by the blade. Thrown objects can cause serious personal injury.\n7. Plan your mowing pattern to avoid discharge of material toward roads, sidewalks, bystanders and the like. Also, avoid discharging material against a wall or obstruction, which may cause discharged material to ricochet back toward the operator.\n8. To help avoid blade contact or a thrown object injury, stay in operator zone behind handles and keep children, bystanders, helpers and pets at least 75 feet from mower while it is in operation. Stop machine if anyone enters area.\n9. Always wear safety glasses or safety goggles during operation and while performing an adjustment or repair to protect your eyes. Thrown objects which ricochet can cause serious injury to the eyes.\n10. Wear sturdy, rough-soled work shoes and close-fitting slacks and shirts. Shirts and pants that cover the arms and legs and steel-toed shoes are recommended. Never operate this machine in bare feet, sandals, slippery or lightweight (e.g., canvas) shoes.\n11. Do not put hands or feet near rotating parts or under the cutting deck. Contact with blade can amputate fingers, hands, toes and feet.\n12. A missing or damaged discharge cover can cause blade contact or thrown object injuries.\n13. Many injuries occur as a result of the mower being pulled over the foot during a fall caused by slipping or tripping. Do not hold onto the mower if you are falling; release the handle immediately.\n14. Never pull the mower back toward you while you are walking. If you must back the mower away from a wall or obstruction first look down and behind to avoid tripping and then follow these steps:\n    - Step back from mower to fully extend your arms.\n    - Be sure you are well balanced with sure footing.\n    - Pull the mower back slowly, no more than halfway toward you.\n    - Repeat these steps as needed.\n15. Do not operate the mower while under the influence of alcohol or drugs.\n16. Do not engage the self-propelled mechanism on machines so equipped while starting engine.\n17. The blade control is a safety device. Never attempt to bypass its operation. Doing so makes the safety device inoperative and may result in personal injury through contact with the rotating blade. The blade control must operate easily in both directions and automatically return to the disengaged position when released.\n18. Never operate the mower in wet grass. Always be sure of your footing. A slip and fall can cause serious personal injury. If you feel you are losing your footing, release the blade control handle immediately and the blade will stop rotating within three seconds.\n19. Mow only in daylight or good artificial light. Walk, never run.\n20. Stop the blade when crossing gravel drives, walks or roads.\n21. If the equipment should start to vibrate abnormally, stop the engine and check immediately for the cause. Vibration is generally a warning of trouble.\n22. Shut the engine off and wait until the blade comes to a complete stop before removing the grass catcher or unclogging the chute. The cutting blade continues to rotate for a few seconds after the blade control is released. Never place any part of the body in the blade area until you are sure the blade has stopped rotating.\n23. Never operate mower without proper trail shield, discharge cover, grass catcher, blade control or other safety protective devices in place and working. Never operate mower with damaged safety devices. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.\n24. Muffler and engine become hot and can cause a burn. Do not touch.\n25. Never attempt to make a wheel or cutting height adjustment while the engine is running.\n26. Only use parts and accessories made for this machine by the manufacturer. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.",
            "27. When starting engine, pull cord slowly until resistance is felt, then pull rapidly. Rapid retraction of starter cord (kickback) will pull hand and arm toward engine faster than you can let go. Broken bones, fractures, bruises or sprains could result.\n28. If situations occur which are not covered in this manual, use care and good judgment. Contact Customer Support for assistance and the name of your nearest servicing dealer.",
            "### Children\n\nTragic accidents can occur if the operator is not alert to the presence of children. Children are often attracted to the mower and the mowing activity. They do not understand the dangers. Never assume that children will remain where you last saw them.\n\n1. Keep children out of the mowing area and under watchful care of a responsible adult other than the operator.\n2. Be alert and turn mower off if a child enters the area.\n3. Before and while moving backwards, look behind and down for small children.\n4. Use extreme care when approaching blind corners, doorways, shrubs, trees, or other objects that may block your vision of a child who may run into the mower.\n5. Keep children away from hot or running engines. They can suffer burns from a hot muffler.\n6. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and be trained and supervised by an adult.\n\n### Service\n\nSafe Handling of Gasoline\n\nTo avoid personal injury or property damage, use extreme care in handling gasoline. Gasoline is extremely flammable and the vapors are explosive. Serious personal injury can occur when gasoline is spilled on yourself or your clothes, which can ignite. Wash your skin and change clothes immediately.\n\n1. Use only an approved gasoline container.\n2. Never fill containers inside a vehicle or on a truck or trailer bed with a plastic liner. Always place containers on the ground away from your vehicle before filling.\n3. Remove gas-powered equipment from the truck or trailer and refuel it on the ground. If this is not possible, then refuel such equipment on a trailer with a portable container, rather than from a gasoline dispenser nozzle.\n4. Keep the nozzle in contact with the rim of the fuel tank or container opening at all times until fueling is complete. Do not use a nozzle lock-open device.\n5. Extinguish all cigarettes, cigars, pipes and other sources of ignition.\n6. Never fuel machine indoors because flammable vapors will accumulate in the area.\n7. Never remove gas cap or add fuel while the engine is hot or running. Allow engine to cool at least two minutes before refueling.\n8. Never overfill fuel tank. Fill tank to no more than \u00bd inch below bottom of filler neck to provide space for fuel expansion.\n9. Replace gasoline cap and tighten securely.\n10. If gasoline is spilled, wipe it off the engine and equipment. Move machine to another area. Wait 5 minutes before starting engine.\n11. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light (e.g. furnace, water heater, space heater, clothes dryer, etc.).\n12. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n13. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light such as a water heater, furnace, clothes dryer etc.\n14. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n\n---\n\n## General Service\n\n1. Never run an engine indoors or in a poorly ventilated area. Engine exhaust contains carbon monoxide, an odorless and deadly gas.\n2. Before cleaning, repairing, or inspecting, make certain the blade and all moving parts have stopped. Disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine to prevent unintended starting.\n3. Check the blade and engine mounting bolts at frequent intervals for proper tightness. Also, visually inspect blade for damage (e.g., bent, cracked, worn). Replace blade with the original equipment manufacturer\u2019s (O.E.M.) blade only, listed in this manual. \u201cUse of parts which do not meet the original equipment specifications may lead to improper performance and compromise safety!\u201d\n4. Mower blades are sharp and can cut. Wrap the blade or wear gloves, and use extra caution when servicing them.\n5. Keep all nuts, bolts, and screws tight to be sure the equipment is in safe working condition.\n6. Never tamper with safety devices. Check their proper operation regularly.\n7. After striking a foreign object, stop the engine, disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine. Thoroughly inspect the mower for any damage. Repair the damage before starting and operating the mower.\n8. Never attempt to make adjustments or repairs to the mower while the engine is running.\n9. Grass catcher components are subject to wear, damage and deterioration, which could expose moving parts or allow objects to be thrown. Frequently check components and replace with the manufacturer\u2019s recommended parts when necessary.\n10. Mower blades are sharp and can cut.

            "### DANGER\n\nThis machine was built to be operated according to the safe operation practices in this manual. As with any type of power equipment, carelessness or error on the part of the operator can result in serious injury. This machine is capable of amputating fingers, hands, toes and feet and throwing objects. Failure to observe the following safety instructions could result in serious injury or death.\n\n### General Operation",
            "1. Read this operator's manual carefully in its entirety before attempting to assemble this machine. Read, understand, and follow all instructions on the machine and in the manual(s) before operation. Keep this manual in a safe place for future and regular reference and for ordering replacement parts.\n2. Be completely familiar with the controls and the proper use of this machine before operating it.\n3. This machine is a precision piece of power equipment, not a plaything. Therefore, exercise extreme caution at all times. This machine has been designed to perform one job: to mow grass. Do not use it for any other purpose.\n4. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and should be trained and supervised by an adult.\n5. Only responsible individuals who are familiar with these rules of safe operation should be allowed to use this machine.\n6. Thoroughly inspect the area where the equipment is to be used. Remove all stones, sticks, wire, bones, toys and other foreign objects, which could be tripped over or picked up and thrown by the blade. Thrown objects can cause serious personal injury.\n7. Plan your mowing pattern to avoid discharge of material toward roads, sidewalks, bystanders and the like. Also, avoid discharging material against a wall or obstruction, which may cause discharged material to ricochet back toward the operator.\n8. To help avoid blade contact or a thrown object injury, stay in operator zone behind handles and keep children, bystanders, helpers and pets at least 75 feet from mower while it is in operation. Stop machine if anyone enters area.\n9. Always wear safety glasses or safety goggles during operation and while performing an adjustment or repair to protect your eyes. Thrown objects which ricochet can cause serious injury to the eyes.\n10. Wear sturdy, rough-soled work shoes and close-fitting slacks and shirts. Shirts and pants that cover the arms and legs and steel-toed shoes are recommended. Never operate this machine in bare feet, sandals, slippery or lightweight (e.g., canvas) shoes.\n11. Do not put hands or feet near rotating parts or under the cutting deck. Contact with blade can amputate fingers, hands, toes and feet.\n12. A missing or damaged discharge cover can cause blade contact or thrown object injuries.\n13. Many injuries occur as a result of the mower being pulled over the foot during a fall caused by slipping or tripping. Do not hold onto the mower if you are falling; release the handle immediately.\n14. Never pull the mower back toward you while you are walking. If you must back the mower away from a wall or obstruction first look down and behind to avoid tripping and then follow these steps:\n    - Step back from mower to fully extend your arms.\n    - Be sure you are well balanced with sure footing.\n    - Pull the mower back slowly, no more than halfway toward you.\n    - Repeat these steps as needed.\n15. Do not operate the mower while under the influence of alcohol or drugs.\n16. Do not engage the self-propelled mechanism on machines so equipped while starting engine.\n17. The blade control is a safety device. Never attempt to bypass its operation. Doing so makes the safety device inoperative and may result in personal injury through contact with the rotating blade. The blade control must operate easily in both directions and automatically return to the disengaged position when released.\n18. Never operate the mower in wet grass. Always be sure of your footing. A slip and fall can cause serious personal injury. If you feel you are losing your footing, release the blade control handle immediately and the blade will stop rotating within three seconds.\n19. Mow only in daylight or good artificial light. Walk, never run.\n20. Stop the blade when crossing gravel drives, walks or roads.\n21. If the equipment should start to vibrate abnormally, stop the engine and check immediately for the cause. Vibration is generally a warning of trouble.\n22. Shut the engine off and wait until the blade comes to a complete stop before removing the grass catcher or unclogging the chute. The cutting blade continues to rotate for a few seconds after the blade control is released. Never place any part of the body in the blade area until you are sure the blade has stopped rotating.\n23. Never operate mower without proper trail shield, discharge cover, grass catcher, blade control or other safety protective devices in place and working. Never operate mower with damaged safety devices. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.\n24. Muffler and engine become hot and can cause a burn. Do not touch.\n25. Never attempt to make a wheel or cutting height adjustment while the engine is running.\n26. Only use parts and accessories made for this machine by the manufacturer. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.",
            "27. When starting engine, pull cord slowly until resistance is felt, then pull rapidly. Rapid retraction of starter cord (kickback) will pull hand and arm toward engine faster than you can let go. Broken bones, fractures, bruises or sprains could result.\n28. If situations occur which are not covered in this manual, use care and good judgment. Contact Customer Support for assistance and the name of your nearest servicing dealer.",
            "### Children\n\nTragic accidents can occur if the operator is not alert to the presence of children. Children are often attracted to the mower and the mowing activity. They do not understand the dangers. Never assume that children will remain where you last saw them.\n\n1. Keep children out of the mowing area and under watchful care of a responsible adult other than the operator.\n2. Be alert and turn mower off if a child enters the area.\n3. Before and while moving backwards, look behind and down for small children.\n4. Use extreme care when approaching blind corners, doorways, shrubs, trees, or other objects that may block your vision of a child who may run into the mower.\n5. Keep children away from hot or running engines. They can suffer burns from a hot muffler.\n6. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and be trained and supervised by an adult.\n\n### Service\n\nSafe Handling of Gasoline\n\nTo avoid personal injury or property damage, use extreme care in handling gasoline. Gasoline is extremely flammable and the vapors are explosive. Serious personal injury can occur when gasoline is spilled on yourself or your clothes, which can ignite. Wash your skin and change clothes immediately.\n\n1. Use only an approved gasoline container.\n2. Never fill containers inside a vehicle or on a truck or trailer bed with a plastic liner. Always place containers on the ground away from your vehicle before filling.\n3. Remove gas-powered equipment from the truck or trailer and refuel it on the ground. If this is not possible, then refuel such equipment on a trailer with a portable container, rather than from a gasoline dispenser nozzle.\n4. Keep the nozzle in contact with the rim of the fuel tank or container opening at all times until fueling is complete. Do not use a nozzle lock-open device.\n5. Extinguish all cigarettes, cigars, pipes and other sources of ignition.\n6. Never fuel machine indoors because flammable vapors will accumulate in the area.\n7. Never remove gas cap or add fuel while the engine is hot or running. Allow engine to cool at least two minutes before refueling.\n8. Never overfill fuel tank. Fill tank to no more than \u00bd inch below bottom of filler neck to provide space for fuel expansion.\n9. Replace gasoline cap and tighten securely.\n10. If gasoline is spilled, wipe it off the engine and equipment. Move machine to another area. Wait 5 minutes before starting engine.\n11. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light (e.g. furnace, water heater, space heater, clothes dryer, etc.).\n12. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n13. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light such as a water heater, furnace, clothes dryer etc.\n14. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n\n---\n\n## General Service\n\n1. Never run an engine indoors or in a poorly ventilated area. Engine exhaust contains carbon monoxide, an odorless and deadly gas.\n2. Before cleaning, repairing, or inspecting, make certain the blade and all moving parts have stopped. Disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine to prevent unintended starting.\n3. Check the blade and engine mounting bolts at frequent intervals for proper tightness. Also, visually inspect blade for damage (e.g., bent, cracked, worn). Replace blade with the original equipment manufacturer\u2019s (O.E.M.) blade only, listed in this manual. \u201cUse of parts which do not meet the original equipment specifications may lead to improper performance and compromise safety!\u201d\n4. Mower blades are sharp and can cut. Wrap the blade or wear gloves, and use extra caution when servicing them.\n5. Keep all nuts, bolts, and screws tight to be sure the equipment is in safe working condition.\n6. Never tamper with safety devices. Check their proper operation regularly.\n7. After striking a foreign object, stop the engine, disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine. Thoroughly inspect the mower for any damage. Repair the damage before starting and operating the mower.\n8. Never attempt to make adjustments or repairs to the mower while the engine is running.\n9. Grass catcher components are subject to wear, damage and deterioration, which could expose moving parts or allow objects to be thrown. Frequently check components and replace with the manufacturer\u2019s recommended parts when necessary.\n10. Mower blades are sharp and can cut.

            "### DANGER\n\nThis machine was built to be operated according to the safe operation practices in this manual. As with any type of power equipment, carelessness or error on the part of the operator can result in serious injury. This machine is capable of amputating fingers, hands, toes and feet and throwing objects. Failure to observe the following safety instructions could result in serious injury or death.\n\n### General Operation",
            "1. Read this operator's manual carefully in its entirety before attempting to assemble this machine. Read, understand, and follow all instructions on the machine and in the manual(s) before operation. Keep this manual in a safe place for future and regular reference and for ordering replacement parts.\n2. Be completely familiar with the controls and the proper use of this machine before operating it.\n3. This machine is a precision piece of power equipment, not a plaything. Therefore, exercise extreme caution at all times. This machine has been designed to perform one job: to mow grass. Do not use it for any other purpose.\n4. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and should be trained and supervised by an adult.\n5. Only responsible individuals who are familiar with these rules of safe operation should be allowed to use this machine.\n6. Thoroughly inspect the area where the equipment is to be used. Remove all stones, sticks, wire, bones, toys and other foreign objects, which could be tripped over or picked up and thrown by the blade. Thrown objects can cause serious personal injury.\n7. Plan your mowing pattern to avoid discharge of material toward roads, sidewalks, bystanders and the like. Also, avoid discharging material against a wall or obstruction, which may cause discharged material to ricochet back toward the operator.\n8. To help avoid blade contact or a thrown object injury, stay in operator zone behind handles and keep children, bystanders, helpers and pets at least 75 feet from mower while it is in operation. Stop machine if anyone enters area.\n9. Always wear safety glasses or safety goggles during operation and while performing an adjustment or repair to protect your eyes. Thrown objects which ricochet can cause serious injury to the eyes.\n10. Wear sturdy, rough-soled work shoes and close-fitting slacks and shirts. Shirts and pants that cover the arms and legs and steel-toed shoes are recommended. Never operate this machine in bare feet, sandals, slippery or lightweight (e.g., canvas) shoes.\n11. Do not put hands or feet near rotating parts or under the cutting deck. Contact with blade can amputate fingers, hands, toes and feet.\n12. A missing or damaged discharge cover can cause blade contact or thrown object injuries.\n13. Many injuries occur as a result of the mower being pulled over the foot during a fall caused by slipping or tripping. Do not hold onto the mower if you are falling; release the handle immediately.\n14. Never pull the mower back toward you while you are walking. If you must back the mower away from a wall or obstruction first look down and behind to avoid tripping and then follow these steps:\n    - Step back from mower to fully extend your arms.\n    - Be sure you are well balanced with sure footing.\n    - Pull the mower back slowly, no more than halfway toward you.\n    - Repeat these steps as needed.\n15. Do not operate the mower while under the influence of alcohol or drugs.\n16. Do not engage the self-propelled mechanism on machines so equipped while starting engine.\n17. The blade control is a safety device. Never attempt to bypass its operation. Doing so makes the safety device inoperative and may result in personal injury through contact with the rotating blade. The blade control must operate easily in both directions and automatically return to the disengaged position when released.\n18. Never operate the mower in wet grass. Always be sure of your footing. A slip and fall can cause serious personal injury. If you feel you are losing your footing, release the blade control handle immediately and the blade will stop rotating within three seconds.\n19. Mow only in daylight or good artificial light. Walk, never run.\n20. Stop the blade when crossing gravel drives, walks or roads.\n21. If the equipment should start to vibrate abnormally, stop the engine and check immediately for the cause. Vibration is generally a warning of trouble.\n22. Shut the engine off and wait until the blade comes to a complete stop before removing the grass catcher or unclogging the chute. The cutting blade continues to rotate for a few seconds after the blade control is released. Never place any part of the body in the blade area until you are sure the blade has stopped rotating.\n23. Never operate mower without proper trail shield, discharge cover, grass catcher, blade control or other safety protective devices in place and working. Never operate mower with damaged safety devices. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.\n24. Muffler and engine become hot and can cause a burn. Do not touch.\n25. Never attempt to make a wheel or cutting height adjustment while the engine is running.\n26. Only use parts and accessories made for this machine by the manufacturer. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.",
            "27. When starting engine, pull cord slowly until resistance is felt, then pull rapidly. Rapid retraction of starter cord (kickback) will pull hand and arm toward engine faster than you can let go. Broken bones, fractures, bruises or sprains could result.\n28. If situations occur which are not covered in this manual, use care and good judgment. Contact Customer Support for assistance and the name of your nearest servicing dealer.",
            "### Children\n\nTragic accidents can occur if the operator is not alert to the presence of children. Children are often attracted to the mower and the mowing activity. They do not understand the dangers. Never assume that children will remain where you last saw them.\n\n1. Keep children out of the mowing area and under watchful care of a responsible adult other than the operator.\n2. Be alert and turn mower off if a child enters the area.\n3. Before and while moving backwards, look behind and down for small children.\n4. Use extreme care when approaching blind corners, doorways, shrubs, trees, or other objects that may block your vision of a child who may run into the mower.\n5. Keep children away from hot or running engines. They can suffer burns from a hot muffler.\n6. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and be trained and supervised by an adult.\n\n### Service\n\nSafe Handling of Gasoline\n\nTo avoid personal injury or property damage, use extreme care in handling gasoline. Gasoline is extremely flammable and the vapors are explosive. Serious personal injury can occur when gasoline is spilled on yourself or your clothes, which can ignite. Wash your skin and change clothes immediately.\n\n1. Use only an approved gasoline container.\n2. Never fill containers inside a vehicle or on a truck or trailer bed with a plastic liner. Always place containers on the ground away from your vehicle before filling.\n3. Remove gas-powered equipment from the truck or trailer and refuel it on the ground. If this is not possible, then refuel such equipment on a trailer with a portable container, rather than from a gasoline dispenser nozzle.\n4. Keep the nozzle in contact with the rim of the fuel tank or container opening at all times until fueling is complete. Do not use a nozzle lock-open device.\n5. Extinguish all cigarettes, cigars, pipes and other sources of ignition.\n6. Never fuel machine indoors because flammable vapors will accumulate in the area.\n7. Never remove gas cap or add fuel while the engine is hot or running. Allow engine to cool at least two minutes before refueling.\n8. Never overfill fuel tank. Fill tank to no more than \u00bd inch below bottom of filler neck to provide space for fuel expansion.\n9. Replace gasoline cap and tighten securely.\n10. If gasoline is spilled, wipe it off the engine and equipment. Move machine to another area. Wait 5 minutes before starting engine.\n11. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light (e.g. furnace, water heater, space heater, clothes dryer, etc.).\n12. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n13. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light such as a water heater, furnace, clothes dryer etc.\n14. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n\n---\n\n## General Service\n\n1. Never run an engine indoors or in a poorly ventilated area. Engine exhaust contains carbon monoxide, an odorless and deadly gas.\n2. Before cleaning, repairing, or inspecting, make certain the blade and all moving parts have stopped. Disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine to prevent unintended starting.\n3. Check the blade and engine mounting bolts at frequent intervals for proper tightness. Also, visually inspect blade for damage (e.g., bent, cracked, worn). Replace blade with the original equipment manufacturer\u2019s (O.E.M.) blade only, listed in this manual. \u201cUse of parts which do not meet the original equipment specifications may lead to improper performance and compromise safety!\u201d\n4. Mower blades are sharp and can cut. Wrap the blade or wear gloves, and use extra caution when servicing them.\n5. Keep all nuts, bolts, and screws tight to be sure the equipment is in safe working condition.\n6. Never tamper with safety devices. Check their proper operation regularly.\n7. After striking a foreign object, stop the engine, disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine. Thoroughly inspect the mower for any damage. Repair the damage before starting and operating the mower.\n8. Never attempt to make adjustments or repairs to the mower while the engine is running.\n9. Grass catcher components are subject to wear, damage and deterioration, which could expose moving parts or allow objects to be thrown. Frequently check components and replace with the manufacturer\u2019s recommended parts when necessary.\n10. Mower blades are sharp and can cut. Wrap the blade or wear gloves, and use extra caution when servicing them.\n11. Do not change the engine governor setting or over-speed the engine.

            "### DANGER\n\nThis machine was built to be operated according to the safe operation practices in this manual. As with any type of power equipment, carelessness or error on the part of the operator can result in serious injury. This machine is capable of amputating fingers, hands, toes and feet and throwing objects. Failure to observe the following safety instructions could result in serious injury or death.\n\n### General Operation",
            "1. Read this operator's manual carefully in its entirety before attempting to assemble this machine. Read, understand, and follow all instructions on the machine and in the manual(s) before operation. Keep this manual in a safe place for future and regular reference and for ordering replacement parts.\n2. Be completely familiar with the controls and the proper use of this machine before operating it.\n3. This machine is a precision piece of power equipment, not a plaything. Therefore, exercise extreme caution at all times. This machine has been designed to perform one job: to mow grass. Do not use it for any other purpose.\n4. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and should be trained and supervised by an adult.\n5. Only responsible individuals who are familiar with these rules of safe operation should be allowed to use this machine.\n6. Thoroughly inspect the area where the equipment is to be used. Remove all stones, sticks, wire, bones, toys and other foreign objects, which could be tripped over or picked up and thrown by the blade. Thrown objects can cause serious personal injury.\n7. Plan your mowing pattern to avoid discharge of material toward roads, sidewalks, bystanders and the like. Also, avoid discharging material against a wall or obstruction, which may cause discharged material to ricochet back toward the operator.\n8. To help avoid blade contact or a thrown object injury, stay in operator zone behind handles and keep children, bystanders, helpers and pets at least 75 feet from mower while it is in operation. Stop machine if anyone enters area.\n9. Always wear safety glasses or safety goggles during operation and while performing an adjustment or repair to protect your eyes. Thrown objects which ricochet can cause serious injury to the eyes.\n10. Wear sturdy, rough-soled work shoes and close-fitting slacks and shirts. Shirts and pants that cover the arms and legs and steel-toed shoes are recommended. Never operate this machine in bare feet, sandals, slippery or lightweight (e.g., canvas) shoes.\n11. Do not put hands or feet near rotating parts or under the cutting deck. Contact with blade can amputate fingers, hands, toes and feet.\n12. A missing or damaged discharge cover can cause blade contact or thrown object injuries.\n13. Many injuries occur as a result of the mower being pulled over the foot during a fall caused by slipping or tripping. Do not hold onto the mower if you are falling; release the handle immediately.\n14. Never pull the mower back toward you while you are walking. If you must back the mower away from a wall or obstruction first look down and behind to avoid tripping and then follow these steps:\n    - Step back from mower to fully extend your arms.\n    - Be sure you are well balanced with sure footing.\n    - Pull the mower back slowly, no more than halfway toward you.\n    - Repeat these steps as needed.\n15. Do not operate the mower while under the influence of alcohol or drugs.\n16. Do not engage the self-propelled mechanism on machines so equipped while starting engine.\n17. The blade control is a safety device. Never attempt to bypass its operation. Doing so makes the safety device inoperative and may result in personal injury through contact with the rotating blade. The blade control must operate easily in both directions and automatically return to the disengaged position when released.\n18. Never operate the mower in wet grass. Always be sure of your footing. A slip and fall can cause serious personal injury. If you feel you are losing your footing, release the blade control handle immediately and the blade will stop rotating within three seconds.\n19. Mow only in daylight or good artificial light. Walk, never run.\n20. Stop the blade when crossing gravel drives, walks or roads.\n21. If the equipment should start to vibrate abnormally, stop the engine and check immediately for the cause. Vibration is generally a warning of trouble.\n22. Shut the engine off and wait until the blade comes to a complete stop before removing the grass catcher or unclogging the chute. The cutting blade continues to rotate for a few seconds after the blade control is released. Never place any part of the body in the blade area until you are sure the blade has stopped rotating.\n23. Never operate mower without proper trail shield, discharge cover, grass catcher, blade control or other safety protective devices in place and working. Never operate mower with damaged safety devices. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.\n24. Muffler and engine become hot and can cause a burn. Do not touch.\n25. Never attempt to make a wheel or cutting height adjustment while the engine is running.\n26. Only use parts and accessories made for this machine by the manufacturer. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.",
            "27. When starting engine, pull cord slowly until resistance is felt, then pull rapidly. Rapid retraction of starter cord (kickback) will pull hand and arm toward engine faster than you can let go. Broken bones, fractures, bruises or sprains could result.\n28. If situations occur which are not covered in this manual, use care and good judgment. Contact Customer Support for assistance and the name of your nearest servicing dealer.",
            "### Children\n\nTragic accidents can occur if the operator is not alert to the presence of children. Children are often attracted to the mower and the mowing activity. They do not understand the dangers. Never assume that children will remain where you last saw them.\n\n1. Keep children out of the mowing area and under watchful care of a responsible adult other than the operator.\n2. Be alert and turn mower off if a child enters the area.\n3. Before and while moving backwards, look behind and down for small children.\n4. Use extreme care when approaching blind corners, doorways, shrubs, trees, or other objects that may block your vision of a child who may run into the mower.\n5. Keep children away from hot or running engines. They can suffer burns from a hot muffler.\n6. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and be trained and supervised by an adult.\n\n### Service\n\nSafe Handling of Gasoline\n\nTo avoid personal injury or property damage, use extreme care in handling gasoline. Gasoline is extremely flammable and the vapors are explosive. Serious personal injury can occur when gasoline is spilled on yourself or your clothes, which can ignite. Wash your skin and change clothes immediately.\n\n1. Use only an approved gasoline container.\n2. Never fill containers inside a vehicle or on a truck or trailer bed with a plastic liner. Always place containers on the ground away from your vehicle before filling.\n3. Remove gas-powered equipment from the truck or trailer and refuel it on the ground. If this is not possible, then refuel such equipment on a trailer with a portable container, rather than from a gasoline dispenser nozzle.\n4. Keep the nozzle in contact with the rim of the fuel tank or container opening at all times until fueling is complete. Do not use a nozzle lock-open device.\n5. Extinguish all cigarettes, cigars, pipes and other sources of ignition.\n6. Never fuel machine indoors because flammable vapors will accumulate in the area.\n7. Never remove gas cap or add fuel while the engine is hot or running. Allow engine to cool at least two minutes before refueling.\n8. Never overfill fuel tank. Fill tank to no more than \u00bd inch below bottom of filler neck to provide space for fuel expansion.\n9. Replace gasoline cap and tighten securely.\n10. If gasoline is spilled, wipe it off the engine and equipment. Move machine to another area. Wait 5 minutes before starting engine.\n11. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light (e.g. furnace, water heater, space heater, clothes dryer, etc.).\n12. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n13. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light such as a water heater, furnace, clothes dryer etc.\n14. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n\n---\n\n## General Service\n\n1. Never run an engine indoors or in a poorly ventilated area. Engine exhaust contains carbon monoxide, an odorless and deadly gas.\n2. Before cleaning, repairing, or inspecting, make certain the blade and all moving parts have stopped. Disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine to prevent unintended starting.\n3. Check the blade and engine mounting bolts at frequent intervals for proper tightness. Also, visually inspect blade for damage (e.g., bent, cracked, worn). Replace blade with the original equipment manufacturer\u2019s (O.E.M.) blade only, listed in this manual. \u201cUse of parts which do not meet the original equipment specifications may lead to improper performance and compromise safety!\u201d\n4. Mower blades are sharp and can cut. Wrap the blade or wear gloves, and use extra caution when servicing them.\n5. Keep all nuts, bolts, and screws tight to be sure the equipment is in safe working condition.\n6. Never tamper with safety devices. Check their proper operation regularly.\n7. After striking a foreign object, stop the engine, disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine. Thoroughly inspect the mower for any damage. Repair the damage before starting and operating the mower.\n8. Never attempt to make adjustments or repairs to the mower while the engine is running.\n9. Grass catcher components are subject to wear, damage and deterioration, which could expose moving parts or allow objects to be thrown. Frequently check components and replace with the manufacturer\u2019s recommended parts when necessary.\n10. Mower blades are sharp and can cut.

            "### DANGER\n\nThis machine was built to be operated according to the safe operation practices in this manual. As with any type of power equipment, carelessness or error on the part of the operator can result in serious injury. This machine is capable of amputating fingers, hands, toes and feet and throwing objects. Failure to observe the following safety instructions could result in serious injury or death.\n\n### General Operation",
            "1. Read this operator's manual carefully in its entirety before attempting to assemble this machine. Read, understand, and follow all instructions on the machine and in the manual(s) before operation. Keep this manual in a safe place for future and regular reference and for ordering replacement parts.\n2. Be completely familiar with the controls and the proper use of this machine before operating it.\n3. This machine is a precision piece of power equipment, not a plaything. Therefore, exercise extreme caution at all times. This machine has been designed to perform one job: to mow grass. Do not use it for any other purpose.\n4. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and should be trained and supervised by an adult.\n5. Only responsible individuals who are familiar with these rules of safe operation should be allowed to use this machine.\n6. Thoroughly inspect the area where the equipment is to be used. Remove all stones, sticks, wire, bones, toys and other foreign objects, which could be tripped over or picked up and thrown by the blade. Thrown objects can cause serious personal injury.\n7. Plan your mowing pattern to avoid discharge of material toward roads, sidewalks, bystanders and the like. Also, avoid discharging material against a wall or obstruction, which may cause discharged material to ricochet back toward the operator.\n8. To help avoid blade contact or a thrown object injury, stay in operator zone behind handles and keep children, bystanders, helpers and pets at least 75 feet from mower while it is in operation. Stop machine if anyone enters area.\n9. Always wear safety glasses or safety goggles during operation and while performing an adjustment or repair to protect your eyes. Thrown objects which ricochet can cause serious injury to the eyes.\n10. Wear sturdy, rough-soled work shoes and close-fitting slacks and shirts. Shirts and pants that cover the arms and legs and steel-toed shoes are recommended. Never operate this machine in bare feet, sandals, slippery or lightweight (e.g., canvas) shoes.\n11. Do not put hands or feet near rotating parts or under the cutting deck. Contact with blade can amputate fingers, hands, toes and feet.\n12. A missing or damaged discharge cover can cause blade contact or thrown object injuries.\n13. Many injuries occur as a result of the mower being pulled over the foot during a fall caused by slipping or tripping. Do not hold onto the mower if you are falling; release the handle immediately.\n14. Never pull the mower back toward you while you are walking. If you must back the mower away from a wall or obstruction first look down and behind to avoid tripping and then follow these steps:\n    - Step back from mower to fully extend your arms.\n    - Be sure you are well balanced with sure footing.\n    - Pull the mower back slowly, no more than halfway toward you.\n    - Repeat these steps as needed.\n15. Do not operate the mower while under the influence of alcohol or drugs.\n16. Do not engage the self-propelled mechanism on machines so equipped while starting engine.\n17. The blade control is a safety device. Never attempt to bypass its operation. Doing so makes the safety device inoperative and may result in personal injury through contact with the rotating blade. The blade control must operate easily in both directions and automatically return to the disengaged position when released.\n18. Never operate the mower in wet grass. Always be sure of your footing. A slip and fall can cause serious personal injury. If you feel you are losing your footing, release the blade control handle immediately and the blade will stop rotating within three seconds.\n19. Mow only in daylight or good artificial light. Walk, never run.\n20. Stop the blade when crossing gravel drives, walks or roads.\n21. If the equipment should start to vibrate abnormally, stop the engine and check immediately for the cause. Vibration is generally a warning of trouble.\n22. Shut the engine off and wait until the blade comes to a complete stop before removing the grass catcher or unclogging the chute. The cutting blade continues to rotate for a few seconds after the blade control is released. Never place any part of the body in the blade area until you are sure the blade has stopped rotating.\n23. Never operate mower without proper trail shield, discharge cover, grass catcher, blade control or other safety protective devices in place and working. Never operate mower with damaged safety devices. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.\n24. Muffler and engine become hot and can cause a burn. Do not touch.\n25. Never attempt to make a wheel or cutting height adjustment while the engine is running.\n26. Only use parts and accessories made for this machine by the manufacturer. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.",
            "27. When starting engine, pull cord slowly until resistance is felt, then pull rapidly. Rapid retraction of starter cord (kickback) will pull hand and arm toward engine faster than you can let go. Broken bones, fractures, bruises or sprains could result.\n28. If situations occur which are not covered in this manual, use care and good judgment. Contact Customer Support for assistance and the name of your nearest servicing dealer.",
            "### Children\n\nTragic accidents can occur if the operator is not alert to the presence of children. Children are often attracted to the mower and the mowing activity. They do not understand the dangers. Never assume that children will remain where you last saw them.\n\n1. Keep children out of the mowing area and under watchful care of a responsible adult other than the operator.\n2. Be alert and turn mower off if a child enters the area.\n3. Before and while moving backwards, look behind and down for small children.\n4. Use extreme care when approaching blind corners, doorways, shrubs, trees, or other objects that may block your vision of a child who may run into the mower.\n5. Keep children away from hot or running engines. They can suffer burns from a hot muffler.\n6. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and be trained and supervised by an adult.\n\n### Service\n\nSafe Handling of Gasoline\n\nTo avoid personal injury or property damage, use extreme care in handling gasoline. Gasoline is extremely flammable and the vapors are explosive. Serious personal injury can occur when gasoline is spilled on yourself or your clothes, which can ignite. Wash your skin and change clothes immediately.\n\n1. Use only an approved gasoline container.\n2. Never fill containers inside a vehicle or on a truck or trailer bed with a plastic liner. Always place containers on the ground away from your vehicle before filling.\n3. Remove gas-powered equipment from the truck or trailer and refuel it on the ground. If this is not possible, then refuel such equipment on a trailer with a portable container, rather than from a gasoline dispenser nozzle.\n4. Keep the nozzle in contact with the rim of the fuel tank or container opening at all times until fueling is complete. Do not use a nozzle lock-open device.\n5. Extinguish all cigarettes, cigars, pipes and other sources of ignition.\n6. Never fuel machine indoors because flammable vapors will accumulate in the area.\n7. Never remove gas cap or add fuel while the engine is hot or running. Allow engine to cool at least two minutes before refueling.\n8. Never overfill fuel tank. Fill tank to no more than \u00bd inch below bottom of filler neck to provide space for fuel expansion.\n9. Replace gasoline cap and tighten securely.\n10. If gasoline is spilled, wipe it off the engine and equipment. Move machine to another area. Wait 5 minutes before starting engine.\n11. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light (e.g. furnace, water heater, space heater, clothes dryer, etc.).\n12. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n13. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light such as a water heater, furnace, clothes dryer etc.\n14. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n\n---\n\n## General Service\n\n1. Never run an engine indoors or in a poorly ventilated area. Engine exhaust contains carbon monoxide, an odorless and deadly gas.\n2. Before cleaning, repairing, or inspecting, make certain the blade and all moving parts have stopped. Disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine to prevent unintended starting.\n3. Check the blade and engine mounting bolts at frequent intervals for proper tightness. Also, visually inspect blade for damage (e.g., bent, cracked, worn). Replace blade with the original equipment manufacturer\u2019s (O.E.M.) blade only, listed in this manual. \u201cUse of parts which do not meet the original equipment specifications may lead to improper performance and compromise safety!\u201d\n4. Mower blades are sharp and can cut. Wrap the blade or wear gloves, and use extra caution when servicing them.\n5. Keep all nuts, bolts, and screws tight to be sure the equipment is in safe working condition.\n6. Never tamper with safety devices. Check their proper operation regularly.\n7. After striking a foreign object, stop the engine, disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine. Thoroughly inspect the mower for any damage. Repair the damage before starting and operating the mower.\n8. Never attempt to make adjustments or repairs to the mower while the engine is running.\n9. Grass catcher components are subject to wear, damage and deterioration, which could expose moving parts or allow objects to be thrown. Frequently check components and replace with the manufacturer\u2019s recommended parts when necessary.\n10. Mower blades are sharp and can cut.

            "### DANGER\n\nThis machine was built to be operated according to the safe operation practices in this manual. As with any type of power equipment, carelessness or error on the part of the operator can result in serious injury. This machine is capable of amputating fingers, hands, toes and feet and throwing objects. Failure to observe the following safety instructions could result in serious injury or death.\n\n### General Operation",
            "1. Read this operator's manual carefully in its entirety before attempting to assemble this machine. Read, understand, and follow all instructions on the machine and in the manual(s) before operation. Keep this manual in a safe place for future and regular reference and for ordering replacement parts.\n2. Be completely familiar with the controls and the proper use of this machine before operating it.\n3. This machine is a precision piece of power equipment, not a plaything. Therefore, exercise extreme caution at all times. This machine has been designed to perform one job: to mow grass. Do not use it for any other purpose.\n4. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and should be trained and supervised by an adult.\n5. Only responsible individuals who are familiar with these rules of safe operation should be allowed to use this machine.\n6. Thoroughly inspect the area where the equipment is to be used. Remove all stones, sticks, wire, bones, toys and other foreign objects, which could be tripped over or picked up and thrown by the blade. Thrown objects can cause serious personal injury.\n7. Plan your mowing pattern to avoid discharge of material toward roads, sidewalks, bystanders and the like. Also, avoid discharging material against a wall or obstruction, which may cause discharged material to ricochet back toward the operator.\n8. To help avoid blade contact or a thrown object injury, stay in operator zone behind handles and keep children, bystanders, helpers and pets at least 75 feet from mower while it is in operation. Stop machine if anyone enters area.\n9. Always wear safety glasses or safety goggles during operation and while performing an adjustment or repair to protect your eyes. Thrown objects which ricochet can cause serious injury to the eyes.\n10. Wear sturdy, rough-soled work shoes and close-fitting slacks and shirts. Shirts and pants that cover the arms and legs and steel-toed shoes are recommended. Never operate this machine in bare feet, sandals, slippery or lightweight (e.g., canvas) shoes.\n11. Do not put hands or feet near rotating parts or under the cutting deck. Contact with blade can amputate fingers, hands, toes and feet.\n12. A missing or damaged discharge cover can cause blade contact or thrown object injuries.\n13. Many injuries occur as a result of the mower being pulled over the foot during a fall caused by slipping or tripping. Do not hold onto the mower if you are falling; release the handle immediately.\n14. Never pull the mower back toward you while you are walking. If you must back the mower away from a wall or obstruction first look down and behind to avoid tripping and then follow these steps:\n    - Step back from mower to fully extend your arms.\n    - Be sure you are well balanced with sure footing.\n    - Pull the mower back slowly, no more than halfway toward you.\n    - Repeat these steps as needed.\n15. Do not operate the mower while under the influence of alcohol or drugs.\n16. Do not engage the self-propelled mechanism on machines so equipped while starting engine.\n17. The blade control is a safety device. Never attempt to bypass its operation. Doing so makes the safety device inoperative and may result in personal injury through contact with the rotating blade. The blade control must operate easily in both directions and automatically return to the disengaged position when released.\n18. Never operate the mower in wet grass. Always be sure of your footing. A slip and fall can cause serious personal injury. If you feel you are losing your footing, release the blade control handle immediately and the blade will stop rotating within three seconds.\n19. Mow only in daylight or good artificial light. Walk, never run.\n20. Stop the blade when crossing gravel drives, walks or roads.\n21. If the equipment should start to vibrate abnormally, stop the engine and check immediately for the cause. Vibration is generally a warning of trouble.\n22. Shut the engine off and wait until the blade comes to a complete stop before removing the grass catcher or unclogging the chute. The cutting blade continues to rotate for a few seconds after the blade control is released. Never place any part of the body in the blade area until you are sure the blade has stopped rotating.\n23. Never operate mower without proper trail shield, discharge cover, grass catcher, blade control or other safety protective devices in place and working. Never operate mower with damaged safety devices. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.\n24. Muffler and engine become hot and can cause a burn. Do not touch.\n25. Never attempt to make a wheel or cutting height adjustment while the engine is running.\n26. Only use parts and accessories made for this machine by the manufacturer. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.",
            "27. When starting engine, pull cord slowly until resistance is felt, then pull rapidly. Rapid retraction of starter cord (kickback) will pull hand and arm toward engine faster than you can let go. Broken bones, fractures, bruises or sprains could result.\n28. If situations occur which are not covered in this manual, use care and good judgment. Contact Customer Support for assistance and the name of your nearest servicing dealer.",
            "### Children\n\nTragic accidents can occur if the operator is not alert to the presence of children. Children are often attracted to the mower and the mowing activity. They do not understand the dangers. Never assume that children will remain where you last saw them.\n\n1. Keep children out of the mowing area and under watchful care of a responsible adult other than the operator.\n2. Be alert and turn mower off if a child enters the area.\n3. Before and while moving backwards, look behind and down for small children.\n4. Use extreme care when approaching blind corners, doorways, shrubs, trees, or other objects that may block your vision of a child who may run into the mower.\n5. Keep children away from hot or running engines. They can suffer burns from a hot muffler.\n6. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and be trained and supervised by an adult.\n\n### Service\n\nSafe Handling of Gasoline\n\nTo avoid personal injury or property damage, use extreme care in handling gasoline. Gasoline is extremely flammable and the vapors are explosive. Serious personal injury can occur when gasoline is spilled on yourself or your clothes, which can ignite. Wash your skin and change clothes immediately.\n\n1. Use only an approved gasoline container.\n2. Never fill containers inside a vehicle or on a truck or trailer bed with a plastic liner. Always place containers on the ground away from your vehicle before filling.\n3. Remove gas-powered equipment from the truck or trailer and refuel it on the ground. If this is not possible, then refuel such equipment on a trailer with a portable container, rather than from a gasoline dispenser nozzle.\n4. Keep the nozzle in contact with the rim of the fuel tank or container opening at all times until fueling is complete. Do not use a nozzle lock-open device.\n5. Extinguish all cigarettes, cigars, pipes and other sources of ignition.\n6. Never fuel machine indoors because flammable vapors will accumulate in the area.\n7. Never remove gas cap or add fuel while the engine is hot or running. Allow engine to cool at least two minutes before refueling.\n8. Never overfill fuel tank. Fill tank to no more than \u00bd inch below bottom of filler neck to provide space for fuel expansion.\n9. Replace gasoline cap and tighten securely.\n10. If gasoline is spilled, wipe it off the engine and equipment. Move machine to another area. Wait 5 minutes before starting engine.\n11. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light (e.g. furnace, water heater, space heater, clothes dryer, etc.).\n12. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n13. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light such as a water heater, furnace, clothes dryer etc.\n14. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n\n---\n\n## General Service\n\n1. Never run an engine indoors or in a poorly ventilated area. Engine exhaust contains carbon monoxide, an odorless and deadly gas.\n2. Before cleaning, repairing, or inspecting, make certain the blade and all moving parts have stopped. Disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine to prevent unintended starting.\n3. Check the blade and engine mounting bolts at frequent intervals for proper tightness. Also, visually inspect blade for damage (e.g., bent, cracked, worn). Replace blade with the original equipment manufacturer\u2019s (O.E.M.) blade only, listed in this manual. \u201cUse of parts which do not meet the original equipment specifications may lead to improper performance and compromise safety!\u201d\n4. Mower blades are sharp and can cut. Wrap the blade or wear gloves, and use extra caution when servicing them.\n5. Keep all nuts, bolts, and screws tight to be sure the equipment is in safe working condition.\n6. Never tamper with safety devices. Check their proper operation regularly.\n7. After striking a foreign object, stop the engine, disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine. Thoroughly inspect the mower for any damage. Repair the damage before starting and operating the mower.\n8. Never attempt to make adjustments or repairs to the mower while the engine is running.\n9. Grass catcher components are subject to wear, damage and deterioration, which could expose moving parts or allow objects to be thrown. Frequently check components and replace with the manufacturer\u2019s recommended parts when necessary.\n10. Mower blades are sharp and can cut.

            "### DANGER\n\nThis machine was built to be operated according to the safe operation practices in this manual. As with any type of power equipment, carelessness or error on the part of the operator can result in serious injury. This machine is capable of amputating fingers, hands, toes and feet and throwing objects. Failure to observe the following safety instructions could result in serious injury or death.\n\n### General Operation",
            "1. Read this operator's manual carefully in its entirety before attempting to assemble this machine. Read, understand, and follow all instructions on the machine and in the manual(s) before operation. Keep this manual in a safe place for future and regular reference and for ordering replacement parts.\n2. Be completely familiar with the controls and the proper use of this machine before operating it.\n3. This machine is a precision piece of power equipment, not a plaything. Therefore, exercise extreme caution at all times. This machine has been designed to perform one job: to mow grass. Do not use it for any other purpose.\n4. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and should be trained and supervised by an adult.\n5. Only responsible individuals who are familiar with these rules of safe operation should be allowed to use this machine.\n6. Thoroughly inspect the area where the equipment is to be used. Remove all stones, sticks, wire, bones, toys and other foreign objects, which could be tripped over or picked up and thrown by the blade. Thrown objects can cause serious personal injury.\n7. Plan your mowing pattern to avoid discharge of material toward roads, sidewalks, bystanders and the like. Also, avoid discharging material against a wall or obstruction, which may cause discharged material to ricochet back toward the operator.\n8. To help avoid blade contact or a thrown object injury, stay in operator zone behind handles and keep children, bystanders, helpers and pets at least 75 feet from mower while it is in operation. Stop machine if anyone enters area.\n9. Always wear safety glasses or safety goggles during operation and while performing an adjustment or repair to protect your eyes. Thrown objects which ricochet can cause serious injury to the eyes.\n10. Wear sturdy, rough-soled work shoes and close-fitting slacks and shirts. Shirts and pants that cover the arms and legs and steel-toed shoes are recommended. Never operate this machine in bare feet, sandals, slippery or lightweight (e.g., canvas) shoes.\n11. Do not put hands or feet near rotating parts or under the cutting deck. Contact with blade can amputate fingers, hands, toes and feet.\n12. A missing or damaged discharge cover can cause blade contact or thrown object injuries.\n13. Many injuries occur as a result of the mower being pulled over the foot during a fall caused by slipping or tripping. Do not hold onto the mower if you are falling; release the handle immediately.\n14. Never pull the mower back toward you while you are walking. If you must back the mower away from a wall or obstruction first look down and behind to avoid tripping and then follow these steps:\n    - Step back from mower to fully extend your arms.\n    - Be sure you are well balanced with sure footing.\n    - Pull the mower back slowly, no more than halfway toward you.\n    - Repeat these steps as needed.\n15. Do not operate the mower while under the influence of alcohol or drugs.\n16. Do not engage the self-propelled mechanism on machines so equipped while starting engine.\n17. The blade control is a safety device. Never attempt to bypass its operation. Doing so makes the safety device inoperative and may result in personal injury through contact with the rotating blade. The blade control must operate easily in both directions and automatically return to the disengaged position when released.\n18. Never operate the mower in wet grass. Always be sure of your footing. A slip and fall can cause serious personal injury. If you feel you are losing your footing, release the blade control handle immediately and the blade will stop rotating within three seconds.\n19. Mow only in daylight or good artificial light. Walk, never run.\n20. Stop the blade when crossing gravel drives, walks or roads.\n21. If the equipment should start to vibrate abnormally, stop the engine and check immediately for the cause. Vibration is generally a warning of trouble.\n22. Shut the engine off and wait until the blade comes to a complete stop before removing the grass catcher or unclogging the chute. The cutting blade continues to rotate for a few seconds after the blade control is released. Never place any part of the body in the blade area until you are sure the blade has stopped rotating.\n23. Never operate mower without proper trail shield, discharge cover, grass catcher, blade control or other safety protective devices in place and working. Never operate mower with damaged safety devices. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.\n24. Muffler and engine become hot and can cause a burn. Do not touch.\n25. Never attempt to make a wheel or cutting height adjustment while the engine is running.\n26. Only use parts and accessories made for this machine by the manufacturer. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.",
            "27. When starting engine, pull cord slowly until resistance is felt, then pull rapidly. Rapid retraction of starter cord (kickback) will pull hand and arm toward engine faster than you can let go. Broken bones, fractures, bruises or sprains could result.\n28. If situations occur which are not covered in this manual, use care and good judgment. Contact Customer Support for assistance and the name of your nearest servicing dealer.",
            "### Children\n\nTragic accidents can occur if the operator is not alert to the presence of children. Children are often attracted to the mower and the mowing activity. They do not understand the dangers. Never assume that children will remain where you last saw them.\n\n1. Keep children out of the mowing area and under watchful care of a responsible adult other than the operator.\n2. Be alert and turn mower off if a child enters the area.\n3. Before and while moving backwards, look behind and down for small children.\n4. Use extreme care when approaching blind corners, doorways, shrubs, trees, or other objects that may block your vision of a child who may run into the mower.\n5. Keep children away from hot or running engines. They can suffer burns from a hot muffler.\n6. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and be trained and supervised by an adult.\n\n### Service\n\nSafe Handling of Gasoline\n\nTo avoid personal injury or property damage, use extreme care in handling gasoline. Gasoline is extremely flammable and the vapors are explosive. Serious personal injury can occur when gasoline is spilled on yourself or your clothes, which can ignite. Wash your skin and change clothes immediately.\n\n1. Use only an approved gasoline container.\n2. Never fill containers inside a vehicle or on a truck or trailer bed with a plastic liner. Always place containers on the ground away from your vehicle before filling.\n3. Remove gas-powered equipment from the truck or trailer and refuel it on the ground. If this is not possible, then refuel such equipment on a trailer with a portable container, rather than from a gasoline dispenser nozzle.\n4. Keep the nozzle in contact with the rim of the fuel tank or container opening at all times until fueling is complete. Do not use a nozzle lock-open device.\n5. Extinguish all cigarettes, cigars, pipes and other sources of ignition.\n6. Never fuel machine indoors because flammable vapors will accumulate in the area.\n7. Never remove gas cap or add fuel while the engine is hot or running. Allow engine to cool at least two minutes before refueling.\n8. Never overfill fuel tank. Fill tank to no more than \u00bd inch below bottom of filler neck to provide space for fuel expansion.\n9. Replace gasoline cap and tighten securely.\n10. If gasoline is spilled, wipe it off the engine and equipment. Move machine to another area. Wait 5 minutes before starting engine.\n11. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light (e.g. furnace, water heater, space heater, clothes dryer, etc.).\n12. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n13. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light such as a water heater, furnace, clothes dryer etc.\n14. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n\n---\n\n## General Service\n\n1. Never run an engine indoors or in a poorly ventilated area. Engine exhaust contains carbon monoxide, an odorless and deadly gas.\n2. Before cleaning, repairing, or inspecting, make certain the blade and all moving parts have stopped. Disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine to prevent unintended starting.\n3. Check the blade and engine mounting bolts at frequent intervals for proper tightness. Also, visually inspect blade for damage (e.g., bent, cracked, worn). Replace blade with the original equipment manufacturer\u2019s (O.E.M.) blade only, listed in this manual. \u201cUse of parts which do not meet the original equipment specifications may lead to improper performance and compromise safety!\u201d\n4. Mower blades are sharp and can cut. Wrap the blade or wear gloves, and use extra caution when servicing them.\n5. Keep all nuts, bolts, and screws tight to be sure the equipment is in safe working condition.\n6. Never tamper with safety devices. Check their proper operation regularly.\n7. After striking a foreign object, stop the engine, disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine. Thoroughly inspect the mower for any damage. Repair the damage before starting and operating the mower.\n8. Never attempt to make adjustments or repairs to the mower while the engine is running.\n9. Grass catcher components are subject to wear, damage and deterioration, which could expose moving parts or allow objects to be thrown. Frequently check components and replace with the manufacturer\u2019s recommended parts when necessary.\n10. Mower blades are sharp and can cut. Wrap the blade or wear gloves, and use extra caution when servicing them.\n11. Do not change the engine governor setting or over-speed the engine.

            "### DANGER\n\nThis machine was built to be operated according to the safe operation practices in this manual. As with any type of power equipment, carelessness or error on the part of the operator can result in serious injury. This machine is capable of amputating fingers, hands, toes and feet and throwing objects. Failure to observe the following safety instructions could result in serious injury or death.\n\n### General Operation",
            "1. Read this operator's manual carefully in its entirety before attempting to assemble this machine. Read, understand, and follow all instructions on the machine and in the manual(s) before operation. Keep this manual in a safe place for future and regular reference and for ordering replacement parts.\n2. Be completely familiar with the controls and the proper use of this machine before operating it.\n3. This machine is a precision piece of power equipment, not a plaything. Therefore, exercise extreme caution at all times. This machine has been designed to perform one job: to mow grass. Do not use it for any other purpose.\n4. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and should be trained and supervised by an adult.\n5. Only responsible individuals who are familiar with these rules of safe operation should be allowed to use this machine.\n6. Thoroughly inspect the area where the equipment is to be used. Remove all stones, sticks, wire, bones, toys and other foreign objects, which could be tripped over or picked up and thrown by the blade. Thrown objects can cause serious personal injury.\n7. Plan your mowing pattern to avoid discharge of material toward roads, sidewalks, bystanders and the like. Also, avoid discharging material against a wall or obstruction, which may cause discharged material to ricochet back toward the operator.\n8. To help avoid blade contact or a thrown object injury, stay in operator zone behind handles and keep children, bystanders, helpers and pets at least 75 feet from mower while it is in operation. Stop machine if anyone enters area.\n9. Always wear safety glasses or safety goggles during operation and while performing an adjustment or repair to protect your eyes. Thrown objects which ricochet can cause serious injury to the eyes.\n10. Wear sturdy, rough-soled work shoes and close-fitting slacks and shirts. Shirts and pants that cover the arms and legs and steel-toed shoes are recommended. Never operate this machine in bare feet, sandals, slippery or lightweight (e.g., canvas) shoes.\n11. Do not put hands or feet near rotating parts or under the cutting deck. Contact with blade can amputate fingers, hands, toes and feet.\n12. A missing or damaged discharge cover can cause blade contact or thrown object injuries.\n13. Many injuries occur as a result of the mower being pulled over the foot during a fall caused by slipping or tripping. Do not hold onto the mower if you are falling; release the handle immediately.\n14. Never pull the mower back toward you while you are walking. If you must back the mower away from a wall or obstruction first look down and behind to avoid tripping and then follow these steps:\n    - Step back from mower to fully extend your arms.\n    - Be sure you are well balanced with sure footing.\n    - Pull the mower back slowly, no more than halfway toward you.\n    - Repeat these steps as needed.\n15. Do not operate the mower while under the influence of alcohol or drugs.\n16. Do not engage the self-propelled mechanism on machines so equipped while starting engine.\n17. The blade control is a safety device. Never attempt to bypass its operation. Doing so makes the safety device inoperative and may result in personal injury through contact with the rotating blade. The blade control must operate easily in both directions and automatically return to the disengaged position when released.\n18. Never operate the mower in wet grass. Always be sure of your footing. A slip and fall can cause serious personal injury. If you feel you are losing your footing, release the blade control handle immediately and the blade will stop rotating within three seconds.\n19. Mow only in daylight or good artificial light. Walk, never run.\n20. Stop the blade when crossing gravel drives, walks or roads.\n21. If the equipment should start to vibrate abnormally, stop the engine and check immediately for the cause. Vibration is generally a warning of trouble.\n22. Shut the engine off and wait until the blade comes to a complete stop before removing the grass catcher or unclogging the chute. The cutting blade continues to rotate for a few seconds after the blade control is released. Never place any part of the body in the blade area until you are sure the blade has stopped rotating.\n23. Never operate mower without proper trail shield, discharge cover, grass catcher, blade control or other safety protective devices in place and working. Never operate mower with damaged safety devices. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.\n24. Muffler and engine become hot and can cause a burn. Do not touch.\n25. Never attempt to make a wheel or cutting height adjustment while the engine is running.\n26. Only use parts and accessories made for this machine by the manufacturer. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.",
            "27. When starting engine, pull cord slowly until resistance is felt, then pull rapidly. Rapid retraction of starter cord (kickback) will pull hand and arm toward engine faster than you can let go. Broken bones, fractures, bruises or sprains could result.\n28. If situations occur which are not covered in this manual, use care and good judgment. Contact Customer Support for assistance and the name of your nearest servicing dealer.",
            "### Children\n\nTragic accidents can occur if the operator is not alert to the presence of children. Children are often attracted to the mower and the mowing activity. They do not understand the dangers. Never assume that children will remain where you last saw them.\n\n1. Keep children out of the mowing area and under watchful care of a responsible adult other than the operator.\n2. Be alert and turn mower off if a child enters the area.\n3. Before and while moving backwards, look behind and down for small children.\n4. Use extreme care when approaching blind corners, doorways, shrubs, trees, or other objects that may block your vision of a child who may run into the mower.\n5. Keep children away from hot or running engines. They can suffer burns from a hot muffler.\n6. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and be trained and supervised by an adult.\n\n### Service\n\nSafe Handling of Gasoline\n\nTo avoid personal injury or property damage, use extreme care in handling gasoline. Gasoline is extremely flammable and the vapors are explosive. Serious personal injury can occur when gasoline is spilled on yourself or your clothes, which can ignite. Wash your skin and change clothes immediately.\n\n1. Use only an approved gasoline container.\n2. Never fill containers inside a vehicle or on a truck or trailer bed with a plastic liner. Always place containers on the ground away from your vehicle before filling.\n3. Remove gas-powered equipment from the truck or trailer and refuel it on the ground. If this is not possible, then refuel such equipment on a trailer with a portable container, rather than from a gasoline dispenser nozzle.\n4. Keep the nozzle in contact with the rim of the fuel tank or container opening at all times until fueling is complete. Do not use a nozzle lock-open device.\n5. Extinguish all cigarettes, cigars, pipes and other sources of ignition.\n6. Never fuel machine indoors because flammable vapors will accumulate in the area.\n7. Never remove gas cap or add fuel while the engine is hot or running. Allow engine to cool at least two minutes before refueling.\n8. Never overfill fuel tank. Fill tank to no more than \u00bd inch below bottom of filler neck to provide space for fuel expansion.\n9. Replace gasoline cap and tighten securely.\n10. If gasoline is spilled, wipe it off the engine and equipment. Move machine to another area. Wait 5 minutes before starting engine.\n11. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light (e.g. furnace, water heater, space heater, clothes dryer, etc.).\n12. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n13. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light such as a water heater, furnace, clothes dryer etc.\n14. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n\n---\n\n## General Service\n\n1. Never run an engine indoors or in a poorly ventilated area. Engine exhaust contains carbon monoxide, an odorless and deadly gas.\n2. Before cleaning, repairing, or inspecting, make certain the blade and all moving parts have stopped. Disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine to prevent unintended starting.\n3. Check the blade and engine mounting bolts at frequent intervals for proper tightness. Also, visually inspect blade for damage (e.g., bent, cracked, worn). Replace blade with the original equipment manufacturer\u2019s (O.E.M.) blade only, listed in this manual. \u201cUse of parts which do not meet the original equipment specifications may lead to improper performance and compromise safety!\u201d\n4. Mower blades are sharp and can cut. Wrap the blade or wear gloves, and use extra caution when servicing them.\n5. Keep all nuts, bolts, and screws tight to be sure the equipment is in safe working condition.\n6. Never tamper with safety devices. Check their proper operation regularly.\n7. After striking a foreign object, stop the engine, disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine. Thoroughly inspect the mower for any damage. Repair the damage before starting and operating the mower.\n8. Never attempt to make adjustments or repairs to the mower while the engine is running.\n9. Grass catcher components are subject to wear, damage and deterioration, which could expose moving parts or allow objects to be thrown. Frequently check components and replace with the manufacturer\u2019s recommended parts when necessary.\n10. Mower blades are sharp and can cut. Wrap the blade or wear gloves, and use extra caution when servicing them.\n11. Do not change the engine governor setting or over-speed the engine.

            "### DANGER\n\nThis machine was built to be operated according to the safe operation practices in this manual. As with any type of power equipment, carelessness or error on the part of the operator can result in serious injury. This machine is capable of amputating fingers, hands, toes and feet and throwing objects. Failure to observe the following safety instructions could result in serious injury or death.\n\n### General Operation",
            "1. Read this operator's manual carefully in its entirety before attempting to assemble this machine. Read, understand, and follow all instructions on the machine and in the manual(s) before operation. Keep this manual in a safe place for future and regular reference and for ordering replacement parts.\n2. Be completely familiar with the controls and the proper use of this machine before operating it.\n3. This machine is a precision piece of power equipment, not a plaything. Therefore, exercise extreme caution at all times. This machine has been designed to perform one job: to mow grass. Do not use it for any other purpose.\n4. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and should be trained and supervised by an adult.\n5. Only responsible individuals who are familiar with these rules of safe operation should be allowed to use this machine.\n6. Thoroughly inspect the area where the equipment is to be used. Remove all stones, sticks, wire, bones, toys and other foreign objects, which could be tripped over or picked up and thrown by the blade. Thrown objects can cause serious personal injury.\n7. Plan your mowing pattern to avoid discharge of material toward roads, sidewalks, bystanders and the like. Also, avoid discharging material against a wall or obstruction, which may cause discharged material to ricochet back toward the operator.\n8. To help avoid blade contact or a thrown object injury, stay in operator zone behind handles and keep children, bystanders, helpers and pets at least 75 feet from mower while it is in operation. Stop machine if anyone enters area.\n9. Always wear safety glasses or safety goggles during operation and while performing an adjustment or repair to protect your eyes. Thrown objects which ricochet can cause serious injury to the eyes.\n10. Wear sturdy, rough-soled work shoes and close-fitting slacks and shirts. Shirts and pants that cover the arms and legs and steel-toed shoes are recommended. Never operate this machine in bare feet, sandals, slippery or lightweight (e.g., canvas) shoes.\n11. Do not put hands or feet near rotating parts or under the cutting deck. Contact with blade can amputate fingers, hands, toes and feet.\n12. A missing or damaged discharge cover can cause blade contact or thrown object injuries.\n13. Many injuries occur as a result of the mower being pulled over the foot during a fall caused by slipping or tripping. Do not hold onto the mower if you are falling; release the handle immediately.\n14. Never pull the mower back toward you while you are walking. If you must back the mower away from a wall or obstruction first look down and behind to avoid tripping and then follow these steps:\n    - Step back from mower to fully extend your arms.\n    - Be sure you are well balanced with sure footing.\n    - Pull the mower back slowly, no more than halfway toward you.\n    - Repeat these steps as needed.\n15. Do not operate the mower while under the influence of alcohol or drugs.\n16. Do not engage the self-propelled mechanism on machines so equipped while starting engine.\n17. The blade control is a safety device. Never attempt to bypass its operation. Doing so makes the safety device inoperative and may result in personal injury through contact with the rotating blade. The blade control must operate easily in both directions and automatically return to the disengaged position when released.\n18. Never operate the mower in wet grass. Always be sure of your footing. A slip and fall can cause serious personal injury. If you feel you are losing your footing, release the blade control handle immediately and the blade will stop rotating within three seconds.\n19. Mow only in daylight or good artificial light. Walk, never run.\n20. Stop the blade when crossing gravel drives, walks or roads.\n21. If the equipment should start to vibrate abnormally, stop the engine and check immediately for the cause. Vibration is generally a warning of trouble.\n22. Shut the engine off and wait until the blade comes to a complete stop before removing the grass catcher or unclogging the chute. The cutting blade continues to rotate for a few seconds after the blade control is released. Never place any part of the body in the blade area until you are sure the blade has stopped rotating.\n23. Never operate mower without proper trail shield, discharge cover, grass catcher, blade control or other safety protective devices in place and working. Never operate mower with damaged safety devices. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.\n24. Muffler and engine become hot and can cause a burn. Do not touch.\n25. Never attempt to make a wheel or cutting height adjustment while the engine is running.\n26. Only use parts and accessories made for this machine by the manufacturer. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.",
            "27. When starting engine, pull cord slowly until resistance is felt, then pull rapidly. Rapid retraction of starter cord (kickback) will pull hand and arm toward engine faster than you can let go. Broken bones, fractures, bruises or sprains could result.\n28. If situations occur which are not covered in this manual, use care and good judgment. Contact Customer Support for assistance and the name of your nearest servicing dealer.",
            "### Children\n\nTragic accidents can occur if the operator is not alert to the presence of children. Children are often attracted to the mower and the mowing activity. They do not understand the dangers. Never assume that children will remain where you last saw them.\n\n1. Keep children out of the mowing area and under watchful care of a responsible adult other than the operator.\n2. Be alert and turn mower off if a child enters the area.\n3. Before and while moving backwards, look behind and down for small children.\n4. Use extreme care when approaching blind corners, doorways, shrubs, trees, or other objects that may block your vision of a child who may run into the mower.\n5. Keep children away from hot or running engines. They can suffer burns from a hot muffler.\n6. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and be trained and supervised by an adult.\n\n### Service\n\nSafe Handling of Gasoline\n\nTo avoid personal injury or property damage, use extreme care in handling gasoline. Gasoline is extremely flammable and the vapors are explosive. Serious personal injury can occur when gasoline is spilled on yourself or your clothes, which can ignite. Wash your skin and change clothes immediately.\n\n1. Use only an approved gasoline container.\n2. Never fill containers inside a vehicle or on a truck or trailer bed with a plastic liner. Always place containers on the ground away from your vehicle before filling.\n3. Remove gas-powered equipment from the truck or trailer and refuel it on the ground. If this is not possible, then refuel such equipment on a trailer with a portable container, rather than from a gasoline dispenser nozzle.\n4. Keep the nozzle in contact with the rim of the fuel tank or container opening at all times until fueling is complete. Do not use a nozzle lock-open device.\n5. Extinguish all cigarettes, cigars, pipes and other sources of ignition.\n6. Never fuel machine indoors because flammable vapors will accumulate in the area.\n7. Never remove gas cap or add fuel while the engine is hot or running. Allow engine to cool at least two minutes before refueling.\n8. Never overfill fuel tank. Fill tank to no more than \u00bd inch below bottom of filler neck to provide space for fuel expansion.\n9. Replace gasoline cap and tighten securely.\n10. If gasoline is spilled, wipe it off the engine and equipment. Move machine to another area. Wait 5 minutes before starting engine.\n11. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light (e.g. furnace, water heater, space heater, clothes dryer, etc.).\n12. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n13. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light such as a water heater, furnace, clothes dryer etc.\n14. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n\n---\n\n## General Service\n\n1. Never run an engine indoors or in a poorly ventilated area. Engine exhaust contains carbon monoxide, an odorless and deadly gas.\n2. Before cleaning, repairing, or inspecting, make certain the blade and all moving parts have stopped. Disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine to prevent unintended starting.\n3. Check the blade and engine mounting bolts at frequent intervals for proper tightness. Also, visually inspect blade for damage (e.g., bent, cracked, worn). Replace blade with the original equipment manufacturer\u2019s (O.E.M.) blade only, listed in this manual. \u201cUse of parts which do not meet the original equipment specifications may lead to improper performance and compromise safety!\u201d\n4. Mower blades are sharp and can cut. Wrap the blade or wear gloves, and use extra caution when servicing them.\n5. Keep all nuts, bolts, and screws tight to be sure the equipment is in safe working condition.\n6. Never tamper with safety devices. Check their proper operation regularly.\n7. After striking a foreign object, stop the engine, disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine. Thoroughly inspect the mower for any damage. Repair the damage before starting and operating the mower.\n8. Never attempt to make adjustments or repairs to the mower while the engine is running.\n9. Grass catcher components are subject to wear, damage and deterioration, which could expose moving parts or allow objects to be thrown. Frequently check components and replace with the manufacturer\u2019s recommended parts when necessary.\n10. Mower blades are sharp and can cut.

            "### DANGER\n\nThis machine was built to be operated according to the safe operation practices in this manual. As with any type of power equipment, carelessness or error on the part of the operator can result in serious injury. This machine is capable of amputating fingers, hands, toes and feet and throwing objects. Failure to observe the following safety instructions could result in serious injury or death.\n\n### General Operation",
            "1. Read this operator's manual carefully in its entirety before attempting to assemble this machine. Read, understand, and follow all instructions on the machine and in the manual(s) before operation. Keep this manual in a safe place for future and regular reference and for ordering replacement parts.\n2. Be completely familiar with the controls and the proper use of this machine before operating it.\n3. This machine is a precision piece of power equipment, not a plaything. Therefore, exercise extreme caution at all times. This machine has been designed to perform one job: to mow grass. Do not use it for any other purpose.\n4. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and should be trained and supervised by an adult.\n5. Only responsible individuals who are familiar with these rules of safe operation should be allowed to use this machine.\n6. Thoroughly inspect the area where the equipment is to be used. Remove all stones, sticks, wire, bones, toys and other foreign objects, which could be tripped over or picked up and thrown by the blade. Thrown objects can cause serious personal injury.\n7. Plan your mowing pattern to avoid discharge of material toward roads, sidewalks, bystanders and the like. Also, avoid discharging material against a wall or obstruction, which may cause discharged material to ricochet back toward the operator.\n8. To help avoid blade contact or a thrown object injury, stay in operator zone behind handles and keep children, bystanders, helpers and pets at least 75 feet from mower while it is in operation. Stop machine if anyone enters area.\n9. Always wear safety glasses or safety goggles during operation and while performing an adjustment or repair to protect your eyes. Thrown objects which ricochet can cause serious injury to the eyes.\n10. Wear sturdy, rough-soled work shoes and close-fitting slacks and shirts. Shirts and pants that cover the arms and legs and steel-toed shoes are recommended. Never operate this machine in bare feet, sandals, slippery or lightweight (e.g., canvas) shoes.\n11. Do not put hands or feet near rotating parts or under the cutting deck. Contact with blade can amputate fingers, hands, toes and feet.\n12. A missing or damaged discharge cover can cause blade contact or thrown object injuries.\n13. Many injuries occur as a result of the mower being pulled over the foot during a fall caused by slipping or tripping. Do not hold onto the mower if you are falling; release the handle immediately.\n14. Never pull the mower back toward you while you are walking. If you must back the mower away from a wall or obstruction first look down and behind to avoid tripping and then follow these steps:\n    - Step back from mower to fully extend your arms.\n    - Be sure you are well balanced with sure footing.\n    - Pull the mower back slowly, no more than halfway toward you.\n    - Repeat these steps as needed.\n15. Do not operate the mower while under the influence of alcohol or drugs.\n16. Do not engage the self-propelled mechanism on machines so equipped while starting engine.\n17. The blade control is a safety device. Never attempt to bypass its operation. Doing so makes the safety device inoperative and may result in personal injury through contact with the rotating blade. The blade control must operate easily in both directions and automatically return to the disengaged position when released.\n18. Never operate the mower in wet grass. Always be sure of your footing. A slip and fall can cause serious personal injury. If you feel you are losing your footing, release the blade control handle immediately and the blade will stop rotating within three seconds.\n19. Mow only in daylight or good artificial light. Walk, never run.\n20. Stop the blade when crossing gravel drives, walks or roads.\n21. If the equipment should start to vibrate abnormally, stop the engine and check immediately for the cause. Vibration is generally a warning of trouble.\n22. Shut the engine off and wait until the blade comes to a complete stop before removing the grass catcher or unclogging the chute. The cutting blade continues to rotate for a few seconds after the blade control is released. Never place any part of the body in the blade area until you are sure the blade has stopped rotating.\n23. Never operate mower without proper trail shield, discharge cover, grass catcher, blade control or other safety protective devices in place and working. Never operate mower with damaged safety devices. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.\n24. Muffler and engine become hot and can cause a burn. Do not touch.\n25. Never attempt to make a wheel or cutting height adjustment while the engine is running.\n26. Only use parts and accessories made for this machine by the manufacturer. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.",
            "27. When starting engine, pull cord slowly until resistance is felt, then pull rapidly. Rapid retraction of starter cord (kickback) will pull hand and arm toward engine faster than you can let go. Broken bones, fractures, bruises or sprains could result.\n28. If situations occur which are not covered in this manual, use care and good judgment. Contact Customer Support for assistance and the name of your nearest servicing dealer.",
            "### Children\n\nTragic accidents can occur if the operator is not alert to the presence of children. Children are often attracted to the mower and the mowing activity. They do not understand the dangers. Never assume that children will remain where you last saw them.\n\n1. Keep children out of the mowing area and under watchful care of a responsible adult other than the operator.\n2. Be alert and turn mower off if a child enters the area.\n3. Before and while moving backwards, look behind and down for small children.\n4. Use extreme care when approaching blind corners, doorways, shrubs, trees, or other objects that may block your vision of a child who may run into the mower.\n5. Keep children away from hot or running engines. They can suffer burns from a hot muffler.\n6. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and be trained and supervised by an adult.\n\n### Service\n\nSafe Handling of Gasoline\n\nTo avoid personal injury or property damage, use extreme care in handling gasoline. Gasoline is extremely flammable and the vapors are explosive. Serious personal injury can occur when gasoline is spilled on yourself or your clothes, which can ignite. Wash your skin and change clothes immediately.\n\n1. Use only an approved gasoline container.\n2. Never fill containers inside a vehicle or on a truck or trailer bed with a plastic liner. Always place containers on the ground away from your vehicle before filling.\n3. Remove gas-powered equipment from the truck or trailer and refuel it on the ground. If this is not possible, then refuel such equipment on a trailer with a portable container, rather than from a gasoline dispenser nozzle.\n4. Keep the nozzle in contact with the rim of the fuel tank or container opening at all times until fueling is complete. Do not use a nozzle lock-open device.\n5. Extinguish all cigarettes, cigars, pipes and other sources of ignition.\n6. Never fuel machine indoors because flammable vapors will accumulate in the area.\n7. Never remove gas cap or add fuel while the engine is hot or running. Allow engine to cool at least two minutes before refueling.\n8. Never overfill fuel tank. Fill tank to no more than \u00bd inch below bottom of filler neck to provide space for fuel expansion.\n9. Replace gasoline cap and tighten securely.\n10. If gasoline is spilled, wipe it off the engine and equipment. Move machine to another area. Wait 5 minutes before starting engine.\n11. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light (e.g. furnace, water heater, space heater, clothes dryer, etc.).\n12. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n13. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light such as a water heater, furnace, clothes dryer etc.\n14. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n\n---\n\n## General Service\n\n1. Never run an engine indoors or in a poorly ventilated area. Engine exhaust contains carbon monoxide, an odorless and deadly gas.\n2. Before cleaning, repairing, or inspecting, make certain the blade and all moving parts have stopped. Disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine to prevent unintended starting.\n3. Check the blade and engine mounting bolts at frequent intervals for proper tightness. Also, visually inspect blade for damage (e.g., bent, cracked, worn). Replace blade with the original equipment manufacturer\u2019s (O.E.M.) blade only, listed in this manual. \u201cUse of parts which do not meet the original equipment specifications may lead to improper performance and compromise safety!\u201d\n4. Mower blades are sharp and can cut. Wrap the blade or wear gloves, and use extra caution when servicing them.\n5. Keep all nuts, bolts, and screws tight to be sure the equipment is in safe working condition.\n6. Never tamper with safety devices. Check their proper operation regularly.\n7. After striking a foreign object, stop the engine, disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine. Thoroughly inspect the mower for any damage. Repair the damage before starting and operating the mower.\n8. Never attempt to make adjustments or repairs to the mower while the engine is running.\n9. Grass catcher components are subject to wear, damage and deterioration, which could expose moving parts or allow objects to be thrown. Frequently check components and replace with the manufacturer\u2019s recommended parts when necessary.\n10. Mower blades are sharp and can cut.

            "### DANGER\n\nThis machine was built to be operated according to the safe operation practices in this manual. As with any type of power equipment, carelessness or error on the part of the operator can result in serious injury. This machine is capable of amputating fingers, hands, toes and feet and throwing objects. Failure to observe the following safety instructions could result in serious injury or death.\n\n### General Operation",
            "1. Read this operator's manual carefully in its entirety before attempting to assemble this machine. Read, understand, and follow all instructions on the machine and in the manual(s) before operation. Keep this manual in a safe place for future and regular reference and for ordering replacement parts.\n2. Be completely familiar with the controls and the proper use of this machine before operating it.\n3. This machine is a precision piece of power equipment, not a plaything. Therefore, exercise extreme caution at all times. This machine has been designed to perform one job: to mow grass. Do not use it for any other purpose.\n4. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and should be trained and supervised by an adult.\n5. Only responsible individuals who are familiar with these rules of safe operation should be allowed to use this machine.\n6. Thoroughly inspect the area where the equipment is to be used. Remove all stones, sticks, wire, bones, toys and other foreign objects, which could be tripped over or picked up and thrown by the blade. Thrown objects can cause serious personal injury.\n7. Plan your mowing pattern to avoid discharge of material toward roads, sidewalks, bystanders and the like. Also, avoid discharging material against a wall or obstruction, which may cause discharged material to ricochet back toward the operator.\n8. To help avoid blade contact or a thrown object injury, stay in operator zone behind handles and keep children, bystanders, helpers and pets at least 75 feet from mower while it is in operation. Stop machine if anyone enters area.\n9. Always wear safety glasses or safety goggles during operation and while performing an adjustment or repair to protect your eyes. Thrown objects which ricochet can cause serious injury to the eyes.\n10. Wear sturdy, rough-soled work shoes and close-fitting slacks and shirts. Shirts and pants that cover the arms and legs and steel-toed shoes are recommended. Never operate this machine in bare feet, sandals, slippery or lightweight (e.g., canvas) shoes.\n11. Do not put hands or feet near rotating parts or under the cutting deck. Contact with blade can amputate fingers, hands, toes and feet.\n12. A missing or damaged discharge cover can cause blade contact or thrown object injuries.\n13. Many injuries occur as a result of the mower being pulled over the foot during a fall caused by slipping or tripping. Do not hold onto the mower if you are falling; release the handle immediately.\n14. Never pull the mower back toward you while you are walking. If you must back the mower away from a wall or obstruction first look down and behind to avoid tripping and then follow these steps:\n    - Step back from mower to fully extend your arms.\n    - Be sure you are well balanced with sure footing.\n    - Pull the mower back slowly, no more than halfway toward you.\n    - Repeat these steps as needed.\n15. Do not operate the mower while under the influence of alcohol or drugs.\n16. Do not engage the self-propelled mechanism on machines so equipped while starting engine.\n17. The blade control is a safety device. Never attempt to bypass its operation. Doing so makes the safety device inoperative and may result in personal injury through contact with the rotating blade. The blade control must operate easily in both directions and automatically return to the disengaged position when released.\n18. Never operate the mower in wet grass. Always be sure of your footing. A slip and fall can cause serious personal injury. If you feel you are losing your footing, release the blade control handle immediately and the blade will stop rotating within three seconds.\n19. Mow only in daylight or good artificial light. Walk, never run.\n20. Stop the blade when crossing gravel drives, walks or roads.\n21. If the equipment should start to vibrate abnormally, stop the engine and check immediately for the cause. Vibration is generally a warning of trouble.\n22. Shut the engine off and wait until the blade comes to a complete stop before removing the grass catcher or unclogging the chute. The cutting blade continues to rotate for a few seconds after the blade control is released. Never place any part of the body in the blade area until you are sure the blade has stopped rotating.\n23. Never operate mower without proper trail shield, discharge cover, grass catcher, blade control or other safety protective devices in place and working. Never operate mower with damaged safety devices. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.\n24. Muffler and engine become hot and can cause a burn. Do not touch.\n25. Never attempt to make a wheel or cutting height adjustment while the engine is running.\n26. Only use parts and accessories made for this machine by the manufacturer. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.",
            "27. When starting engine, pull cord slowly until resistance is felt, then pull rapidly. Rapid retraction of starter cord (kickback) will pull hand and arm toward engine faster than you can let go. Broken bones, fractures, bruises or sprains could result.\n28. If situations occur which are not covered in this manual, use care and good judgment. Contact Customer Support for assistance and the name of your nearest servicing dealer.",
            "### Children\n\nTragic accidents can occur if the operator is not alert to the presence of children. Children are often attracted to the mower and the mowing activity. They do not understand the dangers. Never assume that children will remain where you last saw them.\n\n1. Keep children out of the mowing area and under watchful care of a responsible adult other than the operator.\n2. Be alert and turn mower off if a child enters the area.\n3. Before and while moving backwards, look behind and down for small children.\n4. Use extreme care when approaching blind corners, doorways, shrubs, trees, or other objects that may block your vision of a child who may run into the mower.\n5. Keep children away from hot or running engines. They can suffer burns from a hot muffler.\n6. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and be trained and supervised by an adult.\n\n### Service\n\nSafe Handling of Gasoline\n\nTo avoid personal injury or property damage, use extreme care in handling gasoline. Gasoline is extremely flammable and the vapors are explosive. Serious personal injury can occur when gasoline is spilled on yourself or your clothes, which can ignite. Wash your skin and change clothes immediately.\n\n1. Use only an approved gasoline container.\n2. Never fill containers inside a vehicle or on a truck or trailer bed with a plastic liner. Always place containers on the ground away from your vehicle before filling.\n3. Remove gas-powered equipment from the truck or trailer and refuel it on the ground. If this is not possible, then refuel such equipment on a trailer with a portable container, rather than from a gasoline dispenser nozzle.\n4. Keep the nozzle in contact with the rim of the fuel tank or container opening at all times until fueling is complete. Do not use a nozzle lock-open device.\n5. Extinguish all cigarettes, cigars, pipes and other sources of ignition.\n6. Never fuel machine indoors because flammable vapors will accumulate in the area.\n7. Never remove gas cap or add fuel while the engine is hot or running. Allow engine to cool at least two minutes before refueling.\n8. Never overfill fuel tank. Fill tank to no more than \u00bd inch below bottom of filler neck to provide space for fuel expansion.\n9. Replace gasoline cap and tighten securely.\n10. If gasoline is spilled, wipe it off the engine and equipment. Move machine to another area. Wait 5 minutes before starting engine.\n11. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light (e.g. furnace, water heater, space heater, clothes dryer, etc.).\n12. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n13. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light such as a water heater, furnace, clothes dryer etc.\n14. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n\n---\n\n## General Service\n\n1. Never run an engine indoors or in a poorly ventilated area. Engine exhaust contains carbon monoxide, an odorless and deadly gas.\n2. Before cleaning, repairing, or inspecting, make certain the blade and all moving parts have stopped. Disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine to prevent unintended starting.\n3. Check the blade and engine mounting bolts at frequent intervals for proper tightness. Also, visually inspect blade for damage (e.g., bent, cracked, worn). Replace blade with the original equipment manufacturer\u2019s (O.E.M.) blade only, listed in this manual. \u201cUse of parts which do not meet the original equipment specifications may lead to improper performance and compromise safety!\u201d\n4. Mower blades are sharp and can cut. Wrap the blade or wear gloves, and use extra caution when servicing them.\n5. Keep all nuts, bolts, and screws tight to be sure the equipment is in safe working condition.\n6. Never tamper with safety devices. Check their proper operation regularly.\n7. After striking a foreign object, stop the engine, disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine. Thoroughly inspect the mower for any damage. Repair the damage before starting and operating the mower.\n8. Never attempt to make adjustments or repairs to the mower while the engine is running.\n9. Grass catcher components are subject to wear, damage and deterioration, which could expose moving parts or allow objects to be thrown. Frequently check components and replace with the manufacturer\u2019s recommended parts when necessary.\n10. Mower blades are sharp and can cut.

            "### DANGER\n\nThis machine was built to be operated according to the safe operation practices in this manual. As with any type of power equipment, carelessness or error on the part of the operator can result in serious injury. This machine is capable of amputating fingers, hands, toes and feet and throwing objects. Failure to observe the following safety instructions could result in serious injury or death.\n\n### General Operation",
            "1. Read this operator's manual carefully in its entirety before attempting to assemble this machine. Read, understand, and follow all instructions on the machine and in the manual(s) before operation. Keep this manual in a safe place for future and regular reference and for ordering replacement parts.\n2. Be completely familiar with the controls and the proper use of this machine before operating it.\n3. This machine is a precision piece of power equipment, not a plaything. Therefore, exercise extreme caution at all times. This machine has been designed to perform one job: to mow grass. Do not use it for any other purpose.\n4. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and should be trained and supervised by an adult.\n5. Only responsible individuals who are familiar with these rules of safe operation should be allowed to use this machine.\n6. Thoroughly inspect the area where the equipment is to be used. Remove all stones, sticks, wire, bones, toys and other foreign objects, which could be tripped over or picked up and thrown by the blade. Thrown objects can cause serious personal injury.\n7. Plan your mowing pattern to avoid discharge of material toward roads, sidewalks, bystanders and the like. Also, avoid discharging material against a wall or obstruction, which may cause discharged material to ricochet back toward the operator.\n8. To help avoid blade contact or a thrown object injury, stay in operator zone behind handles and keep children, bystanders, helpers and pets at least 75 feet from mower while it is in operation. Stop machine if anyone enters area.\n9. Always wear safety glasses or safety goggles during operation and while performing an adjustment or repair to protect your eyes. Thrown objects which ricochet can cause serious injury to the eyes.\n10. Wear sturdy, rough-soled work shoes and close-fitting slacks and shirts. Shirts and pants that cover the arms and legs and steel-toed shoes are recommended. Never operate this machine in bare feet, sandals, slippery or lightweight (e.g., canvas) shoes.\n11. Do not put hands or feet near rotating parts or under the cutting deck. Contact with blade can amputate fingers, hands, toes and feet.\n12. A missing or damaged discharge cover can cause blade contact or thrown object injuries.\n13. Many injuries occur as a result of the mower being pulled over the foot during a fall caused by slipping or tripping. Do not hold onto the mower if you are falling; release the handle immediately.\n14. Never pull the mower back toward you while you are walking. If you must back the mower away from a wall or obstruction first look down and behind to avoid tripping and then follow these steps:\n    - Step back from mower to fully extend your arms.\n    - Be sure you are well balanced with sure footing.\n    - Pull the mower back slowly, no more than halfway toward you.\n    - Repeat these steps as needed.\n15. Do not operate the mower while under the influence of alcohol or drugs.\n16. Do not engage the self-propelled mechanism on machines so equipped while starting engine.\n17. The blade control is a safety device. Never attempt to bypass its operation. Doing so makes the safety device inoperative and may result in personal injury through contact with the rotating blade. The blade control must operate easily in both directions and automatically return to the disengaged position when released.\n18. Never operate the mower in wet grass. Always be sure of your footing. A slip and fall can cause serious personal injury. If you feel you are losing your footing, release the blade control handle immediately and the blade will stop rotating within three seconds.\n19. Mow only in daylight or good artificial light. Walk, never run.\n20. Stop the blade when crossing gravel drives, walks or roads.\n21. If the equipment should start to vibrate abnormally, stop the engine and check immediately for the cause. Vibration is generally a warning of trouble.\n22. Shut the engine off and wait until the blade comes to a complete stop before removing the grass catcher or unclogging the chute. The cutting blade continues to rotate for a few seconds after the blade control is released. Never place any part of the body in the blade area until you are sure the blade has stopped rotating.\n23. Never operate mower without proper trail shield, discharge cover, grass catcher, blade control or other safety protective devices in place and working. Never operate mower with damaged safety devices. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.\n24. Muffler and engine become hot and can cause a burn. Do not touch.\n25. Never attempt to make a wheel or cutting height adjustment while the engine is running.\n26. Only use parts and accessories made for this machine by the manufacturer. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.",
            "27. When starting engine, pull cord slowly until resistance is felt, then pull rapidly. Rapid retraction of starter cord (kickback) will pull hand and arm toward engine faster than you can let go. Broken bones, fractures, bruises or sprains could result.\n28. If situations occur which are not covered in this manual, use care and good judgment. Contact Customer Support for assistance and the name of your nearest servicing dealer.",
            "### Children\n\nTragic accidents can occur if the operator is not alert to the presence of children. Children are often attracted to the mower and the mowing activity. They do not understand the dangers. Never assume that children will remain where you last saw them.\n\n1. Keep children out of the mowing area and under watchful care of a responsible adult other than the operator.\n2. Be alert and turn mower off if a child enters the area.\n3. Before and while moving backwards, look behind and down for small children.\n4. Use extreme care when approaching blind corners, doorways, shrubs, trees, or other objects that may block your vision of a child who may run into the mower.\n5. Keep children away from hot or running engines. They can suffer burns from a hot muffler.\n6. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and be trained and supervised by an adult.\n\n### Service\n\nSafe Handling of Gasoline\n\nTo avoid personal injury or property damage, use extreme care in handling gasoline. Gasoline is extremely flammable and the vapors are explosive. Serious personal injury can occur when gasoline is spilled on yourself or your clothes, which can ignite. Wash your skin and change clothes immediately.\n\n1. Use only an approved gasoline container.\n2. Never fill containers inside a vehicle or on a truck or trailer bed with a plastic liner. Always place containers on the ground away from your vehicle before filling.\n3. Remove gas-powered equipment from the truck or trailer and refuel it on the ground. If this is not possible, then refuel such equipment on a trailer with a portable container, rather than from a gasoline dispenser nozzle.\n4. Keep the nozzle in contact with the rim of the fuel tank or container opening at all times until fueling is complete. Do not use a nozzle lock-open device.\n5. Extinguish all cigarettes, cigars, pipes and other sources of ignition.\n6. Never fuel machine indoors because flammable vapors will accumulate in the area.\n7. Never remove gas cap or add fuel while the engine is hot or running. Allow engine to cool at least two minutes before refueling.\n8. Never overfill fuel tank. Fill tank to no more than \u00bd inch below bottom of filler neck to provide space for fuel expansion.\n9. Replace gasoline cap and tighten securely.\n10. If gasoline is spilled, wipe it off the engine and equipment. Move machine to another area. Wait 5 minutes before starting engine.\n11. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light (e.g. furnace, water heater, space heater, clothes dryer, etc.).\n12. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n13. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light such as a water heater, furnace, clothes dryer etc.\n14. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n\n---\n\n## General Service\n\n1. Never run an engine indoors or in a poorly ventilated area. Engine exhaust contains carbon monoxide, an odorless and deadly gas.\n2. Before cleaning, repairing, or inspecting, make certain the blade and all moving parts have stopped. Disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine to prevent unintended starting.\n3. Check the blade and engine mounting bolts at frequent intervals for proper tightness. Also, visually inspect blade for damage (e.g., bent, cracked, worn). Replace blade with the original equipment manufacturer\u2019s (O.E.M.) blade only, listed in this manual. \u201cUse of parts which do not meet the original equipment specifications may lead to improper performance and compromise safety!\u201d\n4. Mower blades are sharp and can cut. Wrap the blade or wear gloves, and use extra caution when servicing them.\n5. Keep all nuts, bolts, and screws tight to be sure the equipment is in safe working condition.\n6. Never tamper with safety devices. Check their proper operation regularly.\n7. After striking a foreign object, stop the engine, disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine. Thoroughly inspect the mower for any damage. Repair the damage before starting and operating the mower.\n8. Never attempt to make adjustments or repairs to the mower while the engine is running.\n9. Grass catcher components are subject to wear, damage and deterioration, which could expose moving parts or allow objects to be thrown. Frequently check components and replace with the manufacturer\u2019s recommended parts when necessary.\n10. Mower blades are sharp and can cut.

            "### DANGER\n\nThis machine was built to be operated according to the safe operation practices in this manual. As with any type of power equipment, carelessness or error on the part of the operator can result in serious injury. This machine is capable of amputating fingers, hands, toes and feet and throwing objects. Failure to observe the following safety instructions could result in serious injury or death.\n\n### General Operation",
            "1. Read this operator's manual carefully in its entirety before attempting to assemble this machine. Read, understand, and follow all instructions on the machine and in the manual(s) before operation. Keep this manual in a safe place for future and regular reference and for ordering replacement parts.\n2. Be completely familiar with the controls and the proper use of this machine before operating it.\n3. This machine is a precision piece of power equipment, not a plaything. Therefore, exercise extreme caution at all times. This machine has been designed to perform one job: to mow grass. Do not use it for any other purpose.\n4. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and should be trained and supervised by an adult.\n5. Only responsible individuals who are familiar with these rules of safe operation should be allowed to use this machine.\n6. Thoroughly inspect the area where the equipment is to be used. Remove all stones, sticks, wire, bones, toys and other foreign objects, which could be tripped over or picked up and thrown by the blade. Thrown objects can cause serious personal injury.\n7. Plan your mowing pattern to avoid discharge of material toward roads, sidewalks, bystanders and the like. Also, avoid discharging material against a wall or obstruction, which may cause discharged material to ricochet back toward the operator.\n8. To help avoid blade contact or a thrown object injury, stay in operator zone behind handles and keep children, bystanders, helpers and pets at least 75 feet from mower while it is in operation. Stop machine if anyone enters area.\n9. Always wear safety glasses or safety goggles during operation and while performing an adjustment or repair to protect your eyes. Thrown objects which ricochet can cause serious injury to the eyes.\n10. Wear sturdy, rough-soled work shoes and close-fitting slacks and shirts. Shirts and pants that cover the arms and legs and steel-toed shoes are recommended. Never operate this machine in bare feet, sandals, slippery or lightweight (e.g., canvas) shoes.\n11. Do not put hands or feet near rotating parts or under the cutting deck. Contact with blade can amputate fingers, hands, toes and feet.\n12. A missing or damaged discharge cover can cause blade contact or thrown object injuries.\n13. Many injuries occur as a result of the mower being pulled over the foot during a fall caused by slipping or tripping. Do not hold onto the mower if you are falling; release the handle immediately.\n14. Never pull the mower back toward you while you are walking. If you must back the mower away from a wall or obstruction first look down and behind to avoid tripping and then follow these steps:\n    - Step back from mower to fully extend your arms.\n    - Be sure you are well balanced with sure footing.\n    - Pull the mower back slowly, no more than halfway toward you.\n    - Repeat these steps as needed.\n15. Do not operate the mower while under the influence of alcohol or drugs.\n16. Do not engage the self-propelled mechanism on machines so equipped while starting engine.\n17. The blade control is a safety device. Never attempt to bypass its operation. Doing so makes the safety device inoperative and may result in personal injury through contact with the rotating blade. The blade control must operate easily in both directions and automatically return to the disengaged position when released.\n18. Never operate the mower in wet grass. Always be sure of your footing. A slip and fall can cause serious personal injury. If you feel you are losing your footing, release the blade control handle immediately and the blade will stop rotating within three seconds.\n19. Mow only in daylight or good artificial light. Walk, never run.\n20. Stop the blade when crossing gravel drives, walks or roads.\n21. If the equipment should start to vibrate abnormally, stop the engine and check immediately for the cause. Vibration is generally a warning of trouble.\n22. Shut the engine off and wait until the blade comes to a complete stop before removing the grass catcher or unclogging the chute. The cutting blade continues to rotate for a few seconds after the blade control is released. Never place any part of the body in the blade area until you are sure the blade has stopped rotating.\n23. Never operate mower without proper trail shield, discharge cover, grass catcher, blade control or other safety protective devices in place and working. Never operate mower with damaged safety devices. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.\n24. Muffler and engine become hot and can cause a burn. Do not touch.\n25. Never attempt to make a wheel or cutting height adjustment while the engine is running.\n26. Only use parts and accessories made for this machine by the manufacturer. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.",
            "27. When starting engine, pull cord slowly until resistance is felt, then pull rapidly. Rapid retraction of starter cord (kickback) will pull hand and arm toward engine faster than you can let go. Broken bones, fractures, bruises or sprains could result.\n28. If situations occur which are not covered in this manual, use care and good judgment. Contact Customer Support for assistance and the name of your nearest servicing dealer.",
            "### Children\n\nTragic accidents can occur if the operator is not alert to the presence of children. Children are often attracted to the mower and the mowing activity. They do not understand the dangers. Never assume that children will remain where you last saw them.\n\n1. Keep children out of the mowing area and under watchful care of a responsible adult other than the operator.\n2. Be alert and turn mower off if a child enters the area.\n3. Before and while moving backwards, look behind and down for small children.\n4. Use extreme care when approaching blind corners, doorways, shrubs, trees, or other objects that may block your vision of a child who may run into the mower.\n5. Keep children away from hot or running engines. They can suffer burns from a hot muffler.\n6. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and be trained and supervised by an adult.\n\n### Service\n\nSafe Handling of Gasoline\n\nTo avoid personal injury or property damage, use extreme care in handling gasoline. Gasoline is extremely flammable and the vapors are explosive. Serious personal injury can occur when gasoline is spilled on yourself or your clothes, which can ignite. Wash your skin and change clothes immediately.\n\n1. Use only an approved gasoline container.\n2. Never fill containers inside a vehicle or on a truck or trailer bed with a plastic liner. Always place containers on the ground away from your vehicle before filling.\n3. Remove gas-powered equipment from the truck or trailer and refuel it on the ground. If this is not possible, then refuel such equipment on a trailer with a portable container, rather than from a gasoline dispenser nozzle.\n4. Keep the nozzle in contact with the rim of the fuel tank or container opening at all times until fueling is complete. Do not use a nozzle lock-open device.\n5. Extinguish all cigarettes, cigars, pipes and other sources of ignition.\n6. Never fuel machine indoors because flammable vapors will accumulate in the area.\n7. Never remove gas cap or add fuel while the engine is hot or running. Allow engine to cool at least two minutes before refueling.\n8. Never overfill fuel tank. Fill tank to no more than \u00bd inch below bottom of filler neck to provide space for fuel expansion.\n9. Replace gasoline cap and tighten securely.\n10. If gasoline is spilled, wipe it off the engine and equipment. Move machine to another area. Wait 5 minutes before starting engine.\n11. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light (e.g. furnace, water heater, space heater, clothes dryer, etc.).\n12. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n13. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light such as a water heater, furnace, clothes dryer etc.\n14. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n\n---\n\n## General Service\n\n1. Never run an engine indoors or in a poorly ventilated area. Engine exhaust contains carbon monoxide, an odorless and deadly gas.\n2. Before cleaning, repairing, or inspecting, make certain the blade and all moving parts have stopped. Disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine to prevent unintended starting.\n3. Check the blade and engine mounting bolts at frequent intervals for proper tightness. Also, visually inspect blade for damage (e.g., bent, cracked, worn). Replace blade with the original equipment manufacturer\u2019s (O.E.M.) blade only, listed in this manual. \u201cUse of parts which do not meet the original equipment specifications may lead to improper performance and compromise safety!\u201d\n4. Mower blades are sharp and can cut. Wrap the blade or wear gloves, and use extra caution when servicing them.\n5. Keep all nuts, bolts, and screws tight to be sure the equipment is in safe working condition.\n6. Never tamper with safety devices. Check their proper operation regularly.\n7. After striking a foreign object, stop the engine, disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine. Thoroughly inspect the mower for any damage. Repair the damage before starting and operating the mower.\n8. Never attempt to make adjustments or repairs to the mower while the engine is running.\n9. Grass catcher components are subject to wear, damage and deterioration, which could expose moving parts or allow objects to be thrown. Frequently check components and replace with the manufacturer\u2019s recommended parts when necessary.\n10. Mower blades are sharp and can cut.

            "### DANGER\n\nThis machine was built to be operated according to the safe operation practices in this manual. As with any type of power equipment, carelessness or error on the part of the operator can result in serious injury. This machine is capable of amputating fingers, hands, toes and feet and throwing objects. Failure to observe the following safety instructions could result in serious injury or death.\n\n### General Operation",
            "1. Read this operator's manual carefully in its entirety before attempting to assemble this machine. Read, understand, and follow all instructions on the machine and in the manual(s) before operation. Keep this manual in a safe place for future and regular reference and for ordering replacement parts.\n2. Be completely familiar with the controls and the proper use of this machine before operating it.\n3. This machine is a precision piece of power equipment, not a plaything. Therefore, exercise extreme caution at all times. This machine has been designed to perform one job: to mow grass. Do not use it for any other purpose.\n4. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and should be trained and supervised by an adult.\n5. Only responsible individuals who are familiar with these rules of safe operation should be allowed to use this machine.\n6. Thoroughly inspect the area where the equipment is to be used. Remove all stones, sticks, wire, bones, toys and other foreign objects, which could be tripped over or picked up and thrown by the blade. Thrown objects can cause serious personal injury.\n7. Plan your mowing pattern to avoid discharge of material toward roads, sidewalks, bystanders and the like. Also, avoid discharging material against a wall or obstruction, which may cause discharged material to ricochet back toward the operator.\n8. To help avoid blade contact or a thrown object injury, stay in operator zone behind handles and keep children, bystanders, helpers and pets at least 75 feet from mower while it is in operation. Stop machine if anyone enters area.\n9. Always wear safety glasses or safety goggles during operation and while performing an adjustment or repair to protect your eyes. Thrown objects which ricochet can cause serious injury to the eyes.\n10. Wear sturdy, rough-soled work shoes and close-fitting slacks and shirts. Shirts and pants that cover the arms and legs and steel-toed shoes are recommended. Never operate this machine in bare feet, sandals, slippery or lightweight (e.g., canvas) shoes.\n11. Do not put hands or feet near rotating parts or under the cutting deck. Contact with blade can amputate fingers, hands, toes and feet.\n12. A missing or damaged discharge cover can cause blade contact or thrown object injuries.\n13. Many injuries occur as a result of the mower being pulled over the foot during a fall caused by slipping or tripping. Do not hold onto the mower if you are falling; release the handle immediately.\n14. Never pull the mower back toward you while you are walking. If you must back the mower away from a wall or obstruction first look down and behind to avoid tripping and then follow these steps:\n    - Step back from mower to fully extend your arms.\n    - Be sure you are well balanced with sure footing.\n    - Pull the mower back slowly, no more than halfway toward you.\n    - Repeat these steps as needed.\n15. Do not operate the mower while under the influence of alcohol or drugs.\n16. Do not engage the self-propelled mechanism on machines so equipped while starting engine.\n17. The blade control is a safety device. Never attempt to bypass its operation. Doing so makes the safety device inoperative and may result in personal injury through contact with the rotating blade. The blade control must operate easily in both directions and automatically return to the disengaged position when released.\n18. Never operate the mower in wet grass. Always be sure of your footing. A slip and fall can cause serious personal injury. If you feel you are losing your footing, release the blade control handle immediately and the blade will stop rotating within three seconds.\n19. Mow only in daylight or good artificial light. Walk, never run.\n20. Stop the blade when crossing gravel drives, walks or roads.\n21. If the equipment should start to vibrate abnormally, stop the engine and check immediately for the cause. Vibration is generally a warning of trouble.\n22. Shut the engine off and wait until the blade comes to a complete stop before removing the grass catcher or unclogging the chute. The cutting blade continues to rotate for a few seconds after the blade control is released. Never place any part of the body in the blade area until you are sure the blade has stopped rotating.\n23. Never operate mower without proper trail shield, discharge cover, grass catcher, blade control or other safety protective devices in place and working. Never operate mower with damaged safety devices. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.\n24. Muffler and engine become hot and can cause a burn. Do not touch.\n25. Never attempt to make a wheel or cutting height adjustment while the engine is running.\n26. Only use parts and accessories made for this machine by the manufacturer. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.",
            "27. When starting engine, pull cord slowly until resistance is felt, then pull rapidly. Rapid retraction of starter cord (kickback) will pull hand and arm toward engine faster than you can let go. Broken bones, fractures, bruises or sprains could result.\n28. If situations occur which are not covered in this manual, use care and good judgment. Contact Customer Support for assistance and the name of your nearest servicing dealer.",
            "### Children\n\nTragic accidents can occur if the operator is not alert to the presence of children. Children are often attracted to the mower and the mowing activity. They do not understand the dangers. Never assume that children will remain where you last saw them.\n\n1. Keep children out of the mowing area and under watchful care of a responsible adult other than the operator.\n2. Be alert and turn mower off if a child enters the area.\n3. Before and while moving backwards, look behind and down for small children.\n4. Use extreme care when approaching blind corners, doorways, shrubs, trees, or other objects that may block your vision of a child who may run into the mower.\n5. Keep children away from hot or running engines. They can suffer burns from a hot muffler.\n6. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and be trained and supervised by an adult.\n\n### Service\n\nSafe Handling of Gasoline\n\nTo avoid personal injury or property damage, use extreme care in handling gasoline. Gasoline is extremely flammable and the vapors are explosive. Serious personal injury can occur when gasoline is spilled on yourself or your clothes, which can ignite. Wash your skin and change clothes immediately.\n\n1. Use only an approved gasoline container.\n2. Never fill containers inside a vehicle or on a truck or trailer bed with a plastic liner. Always place containers on the ground away from your vehicle before filling.\n3. Remove gas-powered equipment from the truck or trailer and refuel it on the ground. If this is not possible, then refuel such equipment on a trailer with a portable container, rather than from a gasoline dispenser nozzle.\n4. Keep the nozzle in contact with the rim of the fuel tank or container opening at all times until fueling is complete. Do not use a nozzle lock-open device.\n5. Extinguish all cigarettes, cigars, pipes and other sources of ignition.\n6. Never fuel machine indoors because flammable vapors will accumulate in the area.\n7. Never remove gas cap or add fuel while the engine is hot or running. Allow engine to cool at least two minutes before refueling.\n8. Never overfill fuel tank. Fill tank to no more than \u00bd inch below bottom of filler neck to provide space for fuel expansion.\n9. Replace gasoline cap and tighten securely.\n10. If gasoline is spilled, wipe it off the engine and equipment. Move machine to another area. Wait 5 minutes before starting engine.\n11. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light (e.g. furnace, water heater, space heater, clothes dryer, etc.).\n12. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n13. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light such as a water heater, furnace, clothes dryer etc.\n14. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n\n---\n\n## General Service\n\n1. Never run an engine indoors or in a poorly ventilated area. Engine exhaust contains carbon monoxide, an odorless and deadly gas.\n2. Before cleaning, repairing, or inspecting, make certain the blade and all moving parts have stopped. Disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine to prevent unintended starting.\n3. Check the blade and engine mounting bolts at frequent intervals for proper tightness. Also, visually inspect blade for damage (e.g., bent, cracked, worn). Replace blade with the original equipment manufacturer\u2019s (O.E.M.) blade only, listed in this manual. \u201cUse of parts which do not meet the original equipment specifications may lead to improper performance and compromise safety!\u201d\n4. Mower blades are sharp and can cut. Wrap the blade or wear gloves, and use extra caution when servicing them.\n5. Keep all nuts, bolts, and screws tight to be sure the equipment is in safe working condition.\n6. Never tamper with safety devices. Check their proper operation regularly.\n7. After striking a foreign object, stop the engine, disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine. Thoroughly inspect the mower for any damage. Repair the damage before starting and operating the mower.\n8. Never attempt to make adjustments or repairs to the mower while the engine is running.\n9. Grass catcher components are subject to wear, damage and deterioration, which could expose moving parts or allow objects to be thrown. Frequently check components and replace with the manufacturer\u2019s recommended parts when necessary.\n10. Mower blades are sharp and can cut.

            "### DANGER\n\nThis machine was built to be operated according to the safe operation practices in this manual. As with any type of power equipment, carelessness or error on the part of the operator can result in serious injury. This machine is capable of amputating fingers, hands, toes and feet and throwing objects. Failure to observe the following safety instructions could result in serious injury or death.\n\n### General Operation",
            "1. Read this operator's manual carefully in its entirety before attempting to assemble this machine. Read, understand, and follow all instructions on the machine and in the manual(s) before operation. Keep this manual in a safe place for future and regular reference and for ordering replacement parts.\n2. Be completely familiar with the controls and the proper use of this machine before operating it.\n3. This machine is a precision piece of power equipment, not a plaything. Therefore, exercise extreme caution at all times. This machine has been designed to perform one job: to mow grass. Do not use it for any other purpose.\n4. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and should be trained and supervised by an adult.\n5. Only responsible individuals who are familiar with these rules of safe operation should be allowed to use this machine.\n6. Thoroughly inspect the area where the equipment is to be used. Remove all stones, sticks, wire, bones, toys and other foreign objects, which could be tripped over or picked up and thrown by the blade. Thrown objects can cause serious personal injury.\n7. Plan your mowing pattern to avoid discharge of material toward roads, sidewalks, bystanders and the like. Also, avoid discharging material against a wall or obstruction, which may cause discharged material to ricochet back toward the operator.\n8. To help avoid blade contact or a thrown object injury, stay in operator zone behind handles and keep children, bystanders, helpers and pets at least 75 feet from mower while it is in operation. Stop machine if anyone enters area.\n9. Always wear safety glasses or safety goggles during operation and while performing an adjustment or repair to protect your eyes. Thrown objects which ricochet can cause serious injury to the eyes.\n10. Wear sturdy, rough-soled work shoes and close-fitting slacks and shirts. Shirts and pants that cover the arms and legs and steel-toed shoes are recommended. Never operate this machine in bare feet, sandals, slippery or lightweight (e.g., canvas) shoes.\n11. Do not put hands or feet near rotating parts or under the cutting deck. Contact with blade can amputate fingers, hands, toes and feet.\n12. A missing or damaged discharge cover can cause blade contact or thrown object injuries.\n13. Many injuries occur as a result of the mower being pulled over the foot during a fall caused by slipping or tripping. Do not hold onto the mower if you are falling; release the handle immediately.\n14. Never pull the mower back toward you while you are walking. If you must back the mower away from a wall or obstruction first look down and behind to avoid tripping and then follow these steps:\n    - Step back from mower to fully extend your arms.\n    - Be sure you are well balanced with sure footing.\n    - Pull the mower back slowly, no more than halfway toward you.\n    - Repeat these steps as needed.\n15. Do not operate the mower while under the influence of alcohol or drugs.\n16. Do not engage the self-propelled mechanism on machines so equipped while starting engine.\n17. The blade control is a safety device. Never attempt to bypass its operation. Doing so makes the safety device inoperative and may result in personal injury through contact with the rotating blade. The blade control must operate easily in both directions and automatically return to the disengaged position when released.\n18. Never operate the mower in wet grass. Always be sure of your footing. A slip and fall can cause serious personal injury. If you feel you are losing your footing, release the blade control handle immediately and the blade will stop rotating within three seconds.\n19. Mow only in daylight or good artificial light. Walk, never run.\n20. Stop the blade when crossing gravel drives, walks or roads.\n21. If the equipment should start to vibrate abnormally, stop the engine and check immediately for the cause. Vibration is generally a warning of trouble.\n22. Shut the engine off and wait until the blade comes to a complete stop before removing the grass catcher or unclogging the chute. The cutting blade continues to rotate for a few seconds after the blade control is released. Never place any part of the body in the blade area until you are sure the blade has stopped rotating.\n23. Never operate mower without proper trail shield, discharge cover, grass catcher, blade control or other safety protective devices in place and working. Never operate mower with damaged safety devices. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.\n24. Muffler and engine become hot and can cause a burn. Do not touch.\n25. Never attempt to make a wheel or cutting height adjustment while the engine is running.\n26. Only use parts and accessories made for this machine by the manufacturer. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.",
            "27. When starting engine, pull cord slowly until resistance is felt, then pull rapidly. Rapid retraction of starter cord (kickback) will pull hand and arm toward engine faster than you can let go. Broken bones, fractures, bruises or sprains could result.\n28. If situations occur which are not covered in this manual, use care and good judgment. Contact Customer Support for assistance and the name of your nearest servicing dealer.",
            "### Children\n\nTragic accidents can occur if the operator is not alert to the presence of children. Children are often attracted to the mower and the mowing activity. They do not understand the dangers. Never assume that children will remain where you last saw them.\n\n1. Keep children out of the mowing area and under watchful care of a responsible adult other than the operator.\n2. Be alert and turn mower off if a child enters the area.\n3. Before and while moving backwards, look behind and down for small children.\n4. Use extreme care when approaching blind corners, doorways, shrubs, trees, or other objects that may block your vision of a child who may run into the mower.\n5. Keep children away from hot or running engines. They can suffer burns from a hot muffler.\n6. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and be trained and supervised by an adult.\n\n### Service\n\nSafe Handling of Gasoline\n\nTo avoid personal injury or property damage, use extreme care in handling gasoline. Gasoline is extremely flammable and the vapors are explosive. Serious personal injury can occur when gasoline is spilled on yourself or your clothes, which can ignite. Wash your skin and change clothes immediately.\n\n1. Use only an approved gasoline container.\n2. Never fill containers inside a vehicle or on a truck or trailer bed with a plastic liner. Always place containers on the ground away from your vehicle before filling.\n3. Remove gas-powered equipment from the truck or trailer and refuel it on the ground. If this is not possible, then refuel such equipment on a trailer with a portable container, rather than from a gasoline dispenser nozzle.\n4. Keep the nozzle in contact with the rim of the fuel tank or container opening at all times until fueling is complete. Do not use a nozzle lock-open device.\n5. Extinguish all cigarettes, cigars, pipes and other sources of ignition.\n6. Never fuel machine indoors because flammable vapors will accumulate in the area.\n7. Never remove gas cap or add fuel while the engine is hot or running. Allow engine to cool at least two minutes before refueling.\n8. Never overfill fuel tank. Fill tank to no more than \u00bd inch below bottom of filler neck to provide space for fuel expansion.\n9. Replace gasoline cap and tighten securely.\n10. If gasoline is spilled, wipe it off the engine and equipment. Move machine to another area. Wait 5 minutes before starting engine.\n11. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light (e.g. furnace, water heater, space heater, clothes dryer, etc.).\n12. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n13. Never store the machine or fuel container inside where there is an open flame, spark or pilot light such as a water heater, furnace, clothes dryer etc.\n14. Allow machine to cool at least 5 minutes before storing.\n\n---\n\n## General Service\n\n1. Never run an engine indoors or in a poorly ventilated area. Engine exhaust contains carbon monoxide, an odorless and deadly gas.\n2. Before cleaning, repairing, or inspecting, make certain the blade and all moving parts have stopped. Disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine to prevent unintended starting.\n3. Check the blade and engine mounting bolts at frequent intervals for proper tightness. Also, visually inspect blade for damage (e.g., bent, cracked, worn). Replace blade with the original equipment manufacturer\u2019s (O.E.M.) blade only, listed in this manual. \u201cUse of parts which do not meet the original equipment specifications may lead to improper performance and compromise safety!\u201d\n4. Mower blades are sharp and can cut. Wrap the blade or wear gloves, and use extra caution when servicing them.\n5. Keep all nuts, bolts, and screws tight to be sure the equipment is in safe working condition.\n6. Never tamper with safety devices. Check their proper operation regularly.\n7. After striking a foreign object, stop the engine, disconnect the spark plug wire and ground against the engine. Thoroughly inspect the mower for any damage. Repair the damage before starting and operating the mower.\n8. Never attempt to make adjustments or repairs to the mower while the engine is running.\n9. Grass catcher components are subject to wear, damage and deterioration, which could expose moving parts or allow objects to be thrown. Frequently check components and replace with the manufacturer\u2019s recommended parts when necessary.\n10. Mower blades are sharp and can cut.

As with any type of power equipment, carelessness or error on the part of the operator can result in serious injury. This machine is capable of amputating fingers, hands, toes and feet and throwing objects. Failure to observe the following safety instructions could result in serious injury or death.\n\n### General Operation",
            "1. Read this operator's manual carefully in its entirety before attempting to assemble this machine. Read, understand, and follow all instructions on the machine and in the manual(s) before operation. Keep this manual in a safe place for future and regular reference and for ordering replacement parts.\n2. Be completely familiar with the controls and the proper use of this machine before operating it.\n3. This machine is a precision piece of power equipment, not a plaything. Therefore, exercise extreme caution at all times. This machine has been designed to perform one job: to mow grass. Do not use it for any other purpose.\n4. Never allow children under 14 years of age to operate this machine. Children 14 and over should read and understand the instructions and safe operation practices in this manual and on the machine and should be trained and supervised by an adult.\n5. Only responsible individuals who are familiar with these rules of safe operation should be allowed to use this machine.\n6. Thoroughly inspect the area where the equipment is to be used. Remove all stones, sticks, wire, bones, toys and other foreign objects, which could be tripped over or picked up and thrown by the blade. Thrown objects can cause serious personal injury.\n7. Plan your mowing pattern to avoid discharge of material toward roads, sidewalks, bystanders and the like. Also, avoid discharging material against a wall or obstruction, which may cause discharged material to ricochet back toward the operator.\n8. To help avoid blade contact or a thrown object injury, stay in operator zone behind handles and keep children, bystanders, helpers and pets at least 75 feet from mower while it is in operation. Stop machine if anyone enters area.\n9. Always wear safety glasses or safety goggles during operation and while performing an adjustment or repair to protect your eyes. Thrown objects which ricochet can cause serious injury to the eyes.\n10. Wear sturdy, rough-soled work shoes and close-fitting slacks and shirts. Shirts and pants that cover the arms and legs and steel-toed shoes are recommended. Never operate this machine in bare feet, sandals, slippery or lightweight (e.g., canvas) shoes.\n11. Do not put hands or feet near rotating parts or under the cutting deck. Contact with blade can amputate fingers, hands, toes and feet.\n12. A missing or damaged discharge cover can cause blade contact or thrown object injuries.\n13. Many injuries occur as a result of the mower being pulled over the foot during a fall caused by slipping or tripping. Do not hold onto the mower if you are falling; release the handle immediately.\n14. Never pull the mower back toward you while you are walking. If you must back the mower away from a wall or obstruction first look down and behind to avoid tripping and then follow these steps:\n    - Step back from mower to fully extend your arms.\n    - Be sure you are well balanced with sure footing.\n    - Pull the mower back slowly, no more than halfway toward you.\n    - Repeat these steps as needed.\n15. Do not operate the mower while under the influence of alcohol or drugs.\n16. Do not engage the self-propelled mechanism on machines so equipped while starting engine.\n17. The blade control is a safety device. Never attempt to bypass its operation. Doing so makes the safety device inoperative and may result in personal injury through contact with the rotating blade. The blade control must operate easily in both directions and automatically return to the disengaged position when released.\n18. Never operate the mower in wet grass. Always be sure of your footing. A slip and fall can cause serious personal injury. If you feel you are losing your footing, release the blade control handle immediately and the blade will stop rotating within three seconds.\n19. Mow only in daylight or good artificial light. Walk, never run.\n20. Stop the blade when crossing gravel drives, walks or roads.\n21. If the equipment should start to vibrate abnormally, stop the engine and check immediately for the cause. Vibration is generally a warning of trouble.\n22. Shut the engine off and wait until the blade comes to a complete stop before removing the grass catcher or unclogging the chute. The cutting blade continues to rotate for a few seconds after the blade control is released. Never place any part of the body in the blade area until you are sure the blade has stopped rotating.\n23. Never operate mower without proper trail shield, discharge cover, grass catcher, blade control or other safety protective devices in place and working. Never operate mower with damaged safety devices. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.\n24. Muffler and engine become hot and can cause a burn. Do not touch.\n25. Never attempt to make a wheel or cutting height adjustment while the engine is running.\n26. Only use parts and accessories made for this machine by the manufacturer. Failure to do so can result in personal injury.",
            "27. When starting engine, pull cord slowly until resistance is felt, then pull rapidly. Rapid retraction of starter cord (kickback) will pull hand and arm toward engine faster than you can let go. Broken bones, fractures, bruises or sprains could result.\n28. If situations occur which are not covered in this manual, use care and good judgment. Contact Customer Support for assistance and the name of your nearest servicing dealer.",
            "### Children\n\nTragic accidents can occur if the operator is not alert to the presence of children. Children are often attracted to the mower and the mowing activity. They do not understand the dangers. Never assume that children will remain where you last saw them.\n\n1. Keep children out of the mowing area and under watchful care of a responsible adult other than the operator.\n2. Be alert and turn mower off if a child enters the area.\n3. Before and while moving backwards, look behind and down for small children.\n4. Use extreme care when approaching blind corners, doorways, shrubs, trees, or other objects that may block your vision of a child who may run into the mower.\n5.
